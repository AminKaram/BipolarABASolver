0002	cuba	no_relation	What I have advocated is that we use all available commuuications - radio , television , and the press - and the moral power of the American Government - to let the forces of freedom in Cuba know that we believe that freedom will again rise in their country . I will be pleased to discuss the whole record of Cuba with you - how this island only 90 miles from our border fell into Communist hands and the sorry record of administration inaction with regard to Cuba . I can not understand , however , why you wish to place a gag on the press in this final debate .	They can say we ca n't object to the Soviet Union moving into Cuba under the Monroe Doctrine - we could at the present time - if the United States is attempting to intervene and move into the internal affairs of Cuba . Let 's suppose the Soviet Union does move into Cuba . Suppose they do move in to help Castro .	Kennedy_October_23_1960	Nixon_October_22_1960
0003	cuba	support	We could have tried to inject ourselves into the Congo without honoring our commitments to the United Nations charter , just as Khrushchev seems to be trying to do . We could have turned Cuba into a second Hungary . But we can be eternally grateful that we have a man in the White House who did none of these things .	I do n't take the views that the only alternative to a dictator is a Communist dictator . If the United States had just had its influence , and at that time the United States was extremely powerful in Cuba , it seems to me we could have persuaded Mr. Batista to hold free elections at the time he was permitted to go and permit the Cuban people to make their choice instead of letting Castro seize power through revolution . I think we are going to have a good deal of trouble in the future with Castro through all of Latin America .	Nixon_September_12_1960	Kennedy_September_2_1960
0004	cuba	support	And the young men and women , those who are students , those who teach them , those who represent the intellectual vitality of these countries , began to look to the United States as a dynamic country which carried with it a hope for a better life for people all over the world . Should we be astonished at what is happening in the Congo today when they have less than a handful , probably less than 14 , college graduates in the whole country ? When there is no officer who is a Negro who is native in any of their armed forces ? Do you think that a country can manage a system as sensitive as democracy when it does not have the chance to educate its people ? In Laos , Cambodia , the Congo , and Cuba we have seen in the last few years the tide turn against us . But I do not concern myself with the feeling that the decline of the United States has set in. This is a great country .	Oh , the problems are great . In Cuba , in the Congo , in the Near East , all over the world , there are problems with which we are confronted and we will continue to be confronted with them in the years ahead . But the opportunities are even greater .	Kennedy_September_2_1960	Nixon_August_26_1960
0005	cuba	attack	I say in that connection that with all the criticism of President Eisenhower 's administration , they ca n't take away the solid fact that under his leadership we got the United States out of one war ; we 've kept her out of other wars , and we do have peace without surrender today . Yes , there are problems , problems like the one in Cuba that my opponent is discussing tonight without offering any solution for , and , incidentally , may I say , looking at that problem , I will have more to say about that at a later time , and he had better look to the record of his administration before he starts criticizing ours in that field . He talks about dictators , and I can only say that the number of dictators we inherited from the Truman administration is far greater than the number we have today in Latin America , and that 's something he must remember .	Major policy on issues such as Cuban security is made at the highest levels - in the National Security Council and elsewhere - and it is the party in power which must accept full responsibility for this disaster . The story of the transformation of Cuba from a friendly ally to a Communist base is - in large measure - the story of a government in Washington which lacked the imagination and compassion to understand the needs of the Cuban people - which lacked the leadership and vigor to move forward to meet those needs - and which lacked the foresight and vision to see the inevitable results of its own failures . And it is a tragic irony that even while these policies of failure here were being pursued our policymakers received repeated and urgent warnings that international communism was becoming a moving force behind Mr. Castro and the revolution - that our interest and the interests of freedom were in danger - that a new Soviet satellite was in the making .	Nixon_October_6_1960	Kennedy_October_6_1960
0008	cuba	attack	These people will feel they have no chance , and then , of course , they will listen to Castros . So I would suggest that the United States try to develop again the spirit of the good neighbor policy of Franklin Roosevelt , that we regard this as the first line of defense , that we bring in students , that we broadcast in Spanish to Cuba and all of Latin America , that we tell our story , that we help them distribute their agricultural products and resources , and maintain their economy and provide a gradual increase in the standard of living for each person . This is the key to Latin America .	He must never be rash or impulsive . That 's why President Eisenhower has followed a policy with regard to Cuba , of quarantining them diplomatically and economically , rather than a policy advocated by some of direct Government intervention in that country . The latter policy sounds good , but the President knew that if he did that , that he would lose , in effect , our allies and friends throughout the world .	Kennedy_November_7_1960	Nixon_November_6_1960
0009	cuba	no_relation	Take my opponent , for example . He says on the Cuban situation that he did not intend to suggest that the American Government should intervene in the internal affairs of Cuba . And yet the words he used ,  the U.S. Government should support the anti-Castro forces in Cuba  have been interpreted by his friends among the press , by all the people abroad , by all of the allies of the United States , as meaning exactly that .	The Associated Press this month featured an excellent survey by Relman Morin entitled  U.S. Prestige Is Damaged in Asia  - citing our image in that continent as that of a  well-meaning but confused and confusing giant .  To the Asian , this report said , the administration 's policy on Cuba  was a clear case of American indecision , fumbling , and possible weakness .  The events of last summer , the survey reported - the U-2 , summit , and Toyko chain of events -  appear to have shown that the United States was weak , indecisive , incapable of evaluating trends , anticipating developments and formulating action to meet them .	Nixon_October_26_1960	Kennedy_October_25_1960
0010	cuba	no_relation	As the President indicated in his press conference in Washington this morning , there 's no question about our attitude toward Cuba , our determination that there will not be set up a foreign-controlled Communist dictatorship in Cuba [ applause ] but what we must remember too is that the United States has the power - and Mr. Castro knows this - to throw him out of office any day that we would choose , but getting rid of Castro is not the answer alone . We have to remember what brought Castro and then we have to give a constructive alternative to the people not only of Cuba , but to the people of all the Latin American countries , where they can see that there is a way to a better life in those countries without turning to Communist dictatorship to get it . This is what we have to prove to them .	Mr. Nixon may now say he has been urging an acceleration of our defense all along - but in his August 10 press conference the President said he knew of no such different viewpoint by the Vice President , adding :  Certainly if there is , he has n't come to me about it .  What was the Security Council doing while the Nation was undergoing this experience ? Why would anyone point with pride to presiding over successive blows to our security and prestige - Indochina , Hungary , Suez , Sputnik , the riots in Venezuela , the collapse of the summit , the riots in Japan , the collapse of the Baghdad Pact , the failure of disarmament , the U-2 fiasco , and now Cuba and the Congo ? Why would anyone boast about presiding over the Security Council during the years it rejected the now accepted findings of the Gaither report , the Killian report , and the Rockefeller report - during the years it held back our missiles and frustrated our efforts in Space - during the years it failed to come up with one new idea of any importance : for  Atoms for Peace  was a slogan , the Eisenhower Middle East Doctrine was a farce , the  open skies  plan was a gesture , and the Baghdad Pact was a failure . Mr. Nixon has presided , in short , over the decline of our national security .	Nixon_August_24_1960	Kennedy_August_24_1960
0012	cuba	no_relation	Now the issues which face us are not merely to maintain employment in Niagara County , not merely to develop the resources of northern New York , not merely to make a better life for our people in New York State and in the United States . Now the President , and therefore the people , have to be concerned with the Congo and Cuba and Laos , countries which most of us had never heard of 10 years ago , and yet which will affect the lives of everyone here - Guinea , Ghana , countries which were colonial countries 2 years ago , now independent . What they do will affect the security of your children in every school in this country .	They feel we were correct , I think , the majority of them , in acting as we did with regard to the sugar , the taking away of special consideration that we had with regard to sugar . They thought that was justified in view of the Cuban Government 's expropriation of much of our property , but I think our present course in Cuba has not lost us friends in Latin America . If anything , it has gained us friends .	Kennedy_September_28_1960	Nixon_September_21_1960
0013	cuba	attack	Secondly , also before the threat reached that stage , each of these areas had been visited by Mr. Richard Nixon . Why was not our Latin American capital investment program strengthened in 1958 , after Mr. Nixon was there , instead of this summer at the point of Mr. Castro 's gun ? Why did we not encourage free elections in Cuba after Mr. Nixon was there in 1955 , in order to stave off a revolt against what he called in a Havana press conference in 1955  the competence and stability  of the Batista dictatorship ? Why are we suddenly embarking now on a crash program for African scholarships for students ? Last year we allocated no scholarships at all to the Congo , practically none to other French and Belgian colonies and , indeed , practically none to the continent of Africa itself . We have allocated more scholarships this summer to the Congo than we allocated to all of Africa a year ago .	Talk about the situation , for example , in Cuba . Does Mr. Khrushchev gain prestige because he shoots down hundreds of thousands of people in the streets of Budapest in Hungary ? And does President Eisenhower lose prestige for America because he does not use our great power as he could against Mr. Castro in Cuba and the Cuban people ? But he works with other American States in developing the opinions which will keep the Cuban people on our side when eventually they get the right to choose the kind of government they want to . No; we gain ; they do n't .	Kennedy_September_29_1960	Nixon_September_21_1960
0014	cuba	no_relation	Three years ago I went to Havana . I was told that the American Ambassador was the second most powerful man in Cuba . Probably he should not be , but he is not today .	This also means that we must be firm every place in the world ; because the road to peace is not through appeasement . And the United States , wherever we find freedom threatened , whether it is in Berlin , whether it is in Cuba , wherever it is in the world - we must make it clear to potential aggressors throughout the world that we will stand with the forces of freedom in resisting the attempts to destroy freedom wherever it is . And so we begin with these two ingredients , which everybody would agree with : Military strength second to none .	Kennedy_August_24_1960	Nixon_August_4_1960
0015	cuba	no_relation	These are the issues which are before the United States and before the United Nations and before the world in the next 10 years . Are other countries of Africa going to join Ghana ? Are other countries of Latin America going to join Cuba ? Are other countries of Asia going to join Laos in the next 10 years ? What contribution can we make to the cause of freedom here in the United States , and the cause of freedom around the world ? I think that is the question that is before us this year . It is not the questions that have been traditionally before us , not the old arguments that divided our party .	And for those who talk about our prestige , does Mr. Khrushchev gain in prestige because he breaks up a conference , a conference that is designed to alleviate tensions ? And does President Eisenhower lose prestige for America because he maintains dignity and say I will go an extra mile ? Of course not . Talk about the situation , for example , in Cuba . Does Mr. Khrushchev gain prestige because he shoots down hundreds of thousands of people in the streets of Budapest in Hungary ? And does President Eisenhower lose prestige for America because he does not use our great power as he could against Mr. Castro in Cuba and the Cuban people ? But he works with other American States in developing the opinions which will keep the Cuban people on our side when eventually they get the right to choose the kind of government they want to .	Kennedy_September_27_1960	Nixon_September_21_1960
0017	cuba	no_relation	And I say to you today that in the affairs of nations , just as in the affairs of individuals , there comes a time when patience , which we have been displaying , is no longer a virtue - and that time is at hand as far as our dealings with Castro and his government are concerned . You will recall that last July we acted to safeguard our future sugar supplies by reducing the share allotted to Cuba . Now we must take further action to protect the interests of the United States and of our friendly sister Republics in the hemisphere .	I approved of his trip . But who does Mr. Nixon think he fools in the last 3 weeks of an election , who does he think he fools when he says we will have no more debates after this week , as he goes around the country casting his innuendoes , suggesting that we in the Democratic Party are not as devoted to the cause of freedom , implying that for some reason or other we were misled by Khrushchev and he understood him all the time ? I was not the Vice President of the United States who presided over the communization of Cuba . [ Applause .	Nixon_October_18_1960	Kennedy_October_18_1960
0018	cuba	no_relation	We see it in the chaos in Africa . And we have seen communism come to within 90 miles of our own shores , in Cuba . It is up to our generation to meet this challenge - to check the advance of communism , and to renew the advance of freedom .	But if I had done so , that would have been a mistake . Do you know who one of those leaders was ? The present President of Venezuela , Mr. Betancourt , a man who is firmly on the side of the United States , a man who is against the Communists , and a man who at the present time is standing with us in our policy of the Organization of American States with regard to Cuba and in other areas . Now I do not give this illustration to point up any personal abilities on my part .	Kennedy_September_15_1960	Nixon_September_13_1960
0020	cuba	no_relation	I think the struggle will be , really , to prevent the spread of Castroism throughout all of South America . Cuba really is an isolated island . The great problem that we face as citizens of this hemisphere is to prevent other countries from following that example .	A major portion of the blame , I say , will rest on Mr. Kennedy , who two weeks before an election has made a statement which not only is provocative , but will be interpreted by the Soviets as an express invitation to do exactly that . And if they do come in you know what the result is ? It can only mean a civil war in Cuba , which the United States would not avoid entering , and this result could easily be spread into a conflict , into a world war , that every American of both parties wants to avoid ; and I say that Senator Kennedy owes it to the Nation to put the cause of peace and freedom before political consideration and to retract this immature , rash , and dangerous suggestion that he has made . Now , some of you who heard the debate , though , will remember that he said :  But , after all , this is nothing new ,  that we helped , he said , the Castro forces get arms and ammunition in the United States when they were supporting their revolution against Batista .	Kennedy_October_23_1960	Nixon_October_22_1960
0021	disarmament	no_relation	They want to go Eisenhower 's way - and that 's our way , and that 's the way we 're going . Now , the last point that I make is one that I make particularly because I know of the great concern the people in these university communities have for the cause of disarmament . People have often spoken to me - my friends who are Quakers , as I am , have written to me - and they have said ,  Mr .	 It is only when we have a military force strong enough to convince the Russians that they 'll never be able to gain any advantage through military strength , only when we can approach the conference table in a position of equality , only then can we hope for fruitful negotiation . Second , we must establish an arms control research institute , under the direction of the President , to undertake , coordinate , and follow through on the research , development , and policy planning needed for a workable disarmament program . Detection and monitoring systems will require new techniques of aerial reconnaissance and radar surveillance , new uses for our communications systems , computers , and cameras , new ways to denature plutonium and inspect power reactors , and a whole host of additional research projects .	Nixon_October_27_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
0024	disarmament	no_relation	Fifth - And most important , the fight for disarmament must command the personal attention and concern of the President of the United States . Our defense and six disarmament experts are concentrated in many important agencies of Government - in the State Department , the Defense Department , the AEC and others . Only the President can overcome the frictions and differences between those agencies ; only he can weld all the parts of the Executive into a singleness of purpose in the pursuit of peace , and only the President can make the hard decisions , decisions involving peace or war , destruction or survival , which peace programs as well as war programs will surely bring .	I believe in this . I want disarmament , above everything else . I want peace above everything else .	Kennedy_October_23_1960	Nixon_October_22_1960
0025	disarmament	attack	 It is impossible for us to provide for the disarmament of outer space , the disarmament of nuclear weapons , unless we are in a position of parity with the Soviet Union . This administration has less than 100 people working in the entire Federal Government on the subject of disarmament . I think we can do a better job than that .	Now , when they make a proposal like this , it 's a cynical attempt to prevent progress , that 's what it is it shows that they do n't really want disarmament . Q. Can you estimate how long your disarmament duties will keep you under this self-imposed noncampaigning status ? A. Well , it is n't really self-imposed . It is - would obviously be inappropriate for me to , as the U.S. representative to the United Nations - to engage in partisan politics .	Kennedy_September_9_1960	Nixon_August_1_1960
0026	disarmament	support	[ Applause . ] Secondly , we must establish an arms control research institute , working full time under the direction of the President , and their function will be to conduct the research and make the studies on which our position will be based at future conferences which must be held in the sixties , on the important subject of disarmament and on the important subject of nuclear test control , a full time institute manned by men whose mission is peace just as we maintain the Pentagon , whose mission is war . We must also give the same attention , certainly as much , and if possible more attention , to the involved and important subject of peace .	We know what peace demands . We will always go the extra mile to strengthen peace , the extra mile to work for disarmament , the extra mile to reduce tensions , but we will always remember that the man we are dealing with and his colleagues are ruthless , fanatical aggressors and that they do not follow the rules of the game that we would like them to follow , and that we must treat them the way they are , and this means that we must never make a concession without being sure that we 're getting one in return , that we must never agree , for example , to disarmament unless we can be sure that they , too , are disarming . Why is this necessary for peace ? Because , as I said at my last stop , we 've got to remember that as long as the United States maintains its present position of being stronger than anyone who threatens the peace of the world we can be the guardians of peace ; but the moment that somebody or some nation that does not want peace - in other words , that would use war as an instrument of conquest - is stronger than we are , or thinks they are , then peace is no longer safe .	Kennedy_October_23_1960	Nixon_October_22_1960
0027	disarmament	attack	People have often spoken to me - my friends who are Quakers , as I am , have written to me - and they have said ,  Mr . Nixon , why does n't the United States show a more flexible attitude ? Why do n't we take the first step toward disarmament ?  Let me tell you what we have done . We have not only taken one step ; we have not only taken two steps , but we have gone the second mile , the third mile , way down the line on disarmament .	We had no position and we adopted that of the British . Our negotiators had to leave Geneva during the Conference itself to come to Washington to find out what our position was , and again we failed to prepare for disarmament . Throughout the consistent history of indifference and failure the arms race has continued to mount .	Nixon_October_27_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
0029	disarmament	no_relation	I select it because I believe it is the most important issue not only of this campaign , but of our time , of our generation , of this country . I select it because I know that the people of this State as the people of the other 49 States of the Union , want leadership which will continue to do what President Eisenhower has done , and for which the American people will be forever grateful to him , leadership that will keep the peace , keep it without surrender , leadership that will extend freedom , extend it without war , leadership which will make us proud of our Nation in the council of nations , leadership in which the President of the United States , when he goes to the United Nations , as a man of dignity , standing for disarmament , standing for progress , standing for helping the unfortunate people of the world , and gaining respect rather than making a fool out of himself as did Mr. Khrushchev when he was there at the United Nations - and I know that everybody in this audience , everybody listening to me on television and radio , recognizes that the problems are difficult , difficult not because of our choosing , difficult not because of the other peace-loving nations - and , fortunately , my friends , they are most of the nations in this world , our allies in Europe and in Asia , the so-called neutrals in Africa , and in South America , and in other countries . Certainly in this period we realize that the problems are difficult only because there is on the loose in the world a great aggressive force , a force which is fanatical which is ruthless , whose leaders do not follow the rules of international diplomacy , as we would like them to be followed , whose leaders - and I know them , and I speak from knowledge - are men who have one objective , and one only , and that is to conquer the world , conquer it without war , if they can , but willing to use any means , if that becomes necessary , and because when we have this kind of leadership , aggressive , always probing , always attempting to embarrass , always moving against us around the world , the period ahead is going to be a difficult one .	He criticized administration farm vetoes . He stressed , and I quote him ,  The necessity for the restoration of cordial relations with Latin America  and he called for more effective action against disarmament . The Democratic nominee in 1928 spoke 30 years ago tonight about building a stronger America , strengthening not only our economy but our sense of moral purpose and our public duty .	Nixon_October_22_1960	Kennedy_October_19_1960
0030	disarmament	support	So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war . That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests . Yes , but we will never agree to an agreement unless the Soviet Union is going to require inspection as well as the United States .	 It is only when we have a military force strong enough to convince the Russians that they 'll never be able to gain any advantage through military strength , only when we can approach the conference table in a position of equality , only then can we hope for fruitful negotiation . Second , we must establish an arms control research institute , under the direction of the President , to undertake , coordinate , and follow through on the research , development , and policy planning needed for a workable disarmament program . Detection and monitoring systems will require new techniques of aerial reconnaissance and radar surveillance , new uses for our communications systems , computers , and cameras , new ways to denature plutonium and inspect power reactors , and a whole host of additional research projects .	Nixon_October_27_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
0031	disarmament	attack	That is why , my friends , that is why the President of the United States has been correct in being firm in dealing with Mr. Khrushchev and not belligerent . That is why he has insisted that while he will always go an extra mile to negotiate disarmament or reduction of tensions , that he will never agree to weaken the United States unless we are sure that the Soviet Union is also reducing its military power at the same time . [ Applause .	If we have the ability to meet the problem of an abundance of food , in an imaginative way , that helps people of the world to realize the blessings the Lord has given them , then we assist ourselves and assist others . If we recognize that we do not have much time , that the nuclear capacity is traveling country after country , almost like a disease , until by the end of the next decade 15 , 20 , or 25 countries will have the power to destroy not merely their adversaries , but perhaps human life , and yet this a Administration has less than 100 people working in the entire Federal Government on the vital subject of disarmament and our negotiators have reflected that disinterest . [ Applause .	Nixon_October_1_1960	Kennedy_September_28_1960
0032	disarmament	no_relation	Now , if I might turn to one other point that I think should be covered on an occasion like this , what should be our diplomatic policy in these years ahead ? Diplomatically , the United States , as the President indicated at Baltimore this morning , must always be ready and willing to sit down at the conference table and discuss disarmament , to discuss any differences that we have with any other nation in the world , because we must work for peace constantly ; but on the other hand , let 's remember , as the President also said this morning , when it comes to disarmament we must never forget that we can take nothing on faith , because America must never give up any of its own strength unless we know that the potential enemies of freedom and of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time . In other words , we can have disarmament only with inspection , with the guarantees which the President has insisted upon and which we will insist upon in the next administration as well . And in the negotiations that we have , as far as these guidelines are concerned , may I suggest these other things should be remembered as well ; we must be firm in our dealings with the Soviet , as I have indicated , but we must be nonbelligerent .	Mr. Khrushchev has stated that he is going to make a special appeal to them . We are going to have a discussion of disarmament . But I do think that in the final analysis that the President should make a judgment as to whether he should attend the United Nations .	Nixon_September_12_1960	Kennedy_September_3_1960
0033	disarmament	attack	The hope for peace is to be firm against those who threaten the peace so that they ca n't blackmail us . The hope for peace is then to go out and sit down , from a position of strength , and negotiate for disarmament for peace but always from strength and never from weakness . And that 's what Cabot Lodge and I will do .	After 3 months , his report was dismissed and so was he , and a New York lawyer , after 5 weeks of preparation , was sent to head up our mission to the Disarmament Conference . One hundred people working on one of the most important , involved , specialized fields the subject of disarmament , nuclear control . I believe we can do better , and I believe we must do better .	Nixon_October_28_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
0034	disarmament	attack	They are afraid of diplomatic policies that teeter on the brink of war . They are dismayed that our negotiators have no solid plans for disarmament . And they are discouraged by a philosophy that puts its faith in swapping threats and insults with the Russians .	It 's a typically specious and frivolous maneuver . We have made a good-faith effort to advance the - advance toward disarmament - and make some progress by having a meeting of the Disarmament Commission . Now , when they make a proposal like this , it 's a cynical attempt to prevent progress , that 's what it is it shows that they do n't really want disarmament .	Kennedy_September_7_1960	Nixon_August_1_1960
0035	disarmament	no_relation	We will never be belligerent . We 're always going to be willing to go the extra mile to negotiate disarmament or anything , but we 're never going to fall into the fatal error of what has got us in war in the past and that is let dictators think that we will not react . So , this is the way to peace , and I want you to know that we will have no greater obligation than to keep the peace for ourselves , for our children , and also to see to it that our children have an opportunity to grow up and have a better life even than we 've had .	[ Applause . ] The struggle for disarmament will not be easy , but I do n't know any easy struggles in the 1960 's . The struggle for freedom in Latin America , the struggle for freedom in Africa , the struggle for freedom in Asia , the maintenance of the security of Western Europe , the maintenance of our commitments to Berlin , the hope for freedom in Eastern Europe , the development of the American economy , the security for American agriculture - all these are difficult problems , but I do not take the view that they are impossible problems .	Nixon_October_28_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
0036	disarmament	no_relation	[ Applause . ] My friends , I know that many well-intentioned people in this audience might well say , but really , Mr. Vice President , is n't there an easier way ? Could n't we agree for some of his proposals ? He says he is for disarmament . Why do n't we agree to it ? Why ca n't we take the first step ? Listen , my friends .	Our chief negotiator admitted at the 1958 conference on preventing surprise attacks that we , and I quote him ,  had n't up to this time really given the intense study of the kind of measure which would make this kind of measure possible ,  had not even intense study to the very program that they were then putting forward . A year ago when we went to the disarmament conference , we appointed an attorney from Massachusetts to set up an ad hoc committee . That committee met for 3 months .	Nixon_November_2_1960	Kennedy_November_2_1960
0037	disarmament	no_relation	And you ask about prestige . What do our opponents think ? Do they think that Mr. Khrushchev gains prestige for the Communists when he takes off his shoe at the United Nations and pounds the table with it ? I say no. I say that President Eisenhower gained prestige for America when with great dignity and great responsibility , he stood for peace , for disarmament , for all the things that Americans believe in. No , my friends , the real test of prestige , if our prestige was low , I can assure you , would occur in the United Nations , and there what do we find ? In every instance where we 've had a test vote - and listen to this - in the last 7 years , with the Soviet Union on one side and the United States on the other , we have won ; and in the vote on the Congo we won , 70 to nothing . My friends , that 's a pretty good score in football .	Yet , in the past 80 years , this problem has been virtually ignored ; we have had no real disarmament policy . And we have completely failed to provide the effort and the leadership which the pursuit of disarmament demands . In the entire U.S. Government we have had fewer than 100 men working on the complex problems of arms control .	Nixon_October_26_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
0038	disarmament	no_relation	People have often spoken to me - my friends who are Quakers , as I am , have written to me - and they have said ,  Mr .

We have not only taken one step ; we have not only taken two steps , but we have gone the second mile , the third mile , way down the line on disarmament .	Perhaps they will not agree to the effective system of inspection and control which is vital to agreement . Perhaps the Communist Chinese will refuse to participate in arms control negotiation , even though their ultimate participation is essential to effective disarmament .

0039	disarmament	support	Fourth , while we are working to dismantle the engines of destruction we must work out methods of protecting ourselves against the growing danger of accidental war , through sure methods of informing ourselves about suspicious events or accidental firings so that neither nation can make a mistake which will trigger nuclear destruction . Fifth - And most important , the fight for disarmament must command the personal attention and concern of the President of the United States . Our defense and six disarmament experts are concentrated in many important agencies of Government - in the State Department , the Defense Department , the AEC and others .	We have to have the power because we are friends of peace . As long as America is the strongest nation in the world , the world need not fear that there will be war , because we will use our strength to keep peace , and I think that all of you , including those who are as dedicated to peace as I am , will say that we want the next President of the United States always to go the extra mile , as President Eisenhower has , to negotiate with Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else for disarmament . We want to go the extra mile to strengthen the United Nations and the instruments of peace , but under no circumstances do we want the next President to be a man who will be fooled , who will make concessions to them without getting concessions in return , and , above all , we do not want the next President to be one who will reduce the strength of America unless we 're absolutely sure that the enemies of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time .

0040	disarmament	attack	 Let me tell you about disarmament . When people say ,  I 'm for disarmament ,  and when some people write to me and say  Why , when Mr. Khrushchev comes over and says he 's for total disarmament - why do we have to insist on inspection ? Why ,  they say ,  could n't we just do it ? Would n't that be real leadership in the world ? Would n't that be bold and imaginative ?  Yes , it would ; but do you know what would happen ? The moment the United States ever enters into an agreement for disarmament , which would result in increasing his strength as against ours , we do n't help the cause of peace . We hurt it , because - why is America the guardian of peace today ? Because we 're the strongest nation in the world , and the difference is : We do n't want to use our strength for anything except to keep the peace .	The pursuit of peace is still the focus of our leadership , our energies , and our determination . And disarmament is still the most vital step on the road to a lasting peace . The great question of the 1960 's - the overriding concern of all Americans and all men - is whether , in the coming decade , the world will move toward a secure peace and the survival of mankind or whether we will move toward war and common destruction .

It was the best medical care that you could possibly get , and we have the best in the world , and we want to keep it that way ; but my mother and father found it difficult to pay those bills . They did .	The only thing that has gone up is the cost of what the farmer buys . Behind these economic facts of life lie human tragedies , inadequate medical care and opportunities for farm people , young people leaving the farm for higher wages in the city , older men who have earned the right to semiretirement but who are forced to stay in harness - or give up their way of life altogether - because their sons are driven to the city and because they ca n't afford hired hands . The father who owns a farm and has thousands of dollars invested in farm equipment ends the year with less return than his factory-employed son  who 's invested in one pair of working gloves .

Mr. Nixon leads a party in this campaign that voted 90 percent in the mid-thirties against social security itself ; and in the month of August 1960 , voted 95 percent against medical care for the aged tied to social security . I believe in an America where every family can live in a decent home in a decent neighborhood ; where children can play safely ; where no home is unsafe or unsanitary , and today there are 15 million American homes which are substandard , and yet , even though our population is increasing , we 're building this year 30 percent less homes in the month of September than we did a year ago - partly , because this administration in the last 15 months has vetoed two housing bills - and we were unable to pass one in this session of the Congress .	Medical care under our old-age assistance program needs to be improved . The Congress in its last session took an important step in the direction of providing more medical care for the neediest . But we can not assume that the problem is solved .	Kennedy_October_31_1960	Nixon_October_30_1960

Under the bill , which the President signed , before you or your mother and father , who may be retired , who may have a heart attack or cancer or sick for several months - before they can get any assistance under that program , they first have to sign a petition that they are medically indigent .	In other words , we have here , you see , a program which covers all of our older citizens , including the 3 million not covered by our opponent 's , which forces nobody into the program who does n't want it , and yet which provides more benefits , and a greater choice of benefits than does our opponent . And I 'm getting tired of having him go around the country and say that we , my party and I , and my running mate , are against medical care for the aged , when it is he who has an inadequate program . We 're for it , and he 's against it , if we really want to lay it on the line .	Kennedy_October_27_1960	Nixon_October_26_1960

[ Applause .	So , on this particular issue I say that the very fact that I stand against this wasting of the people 's money , that I stand against programs that will not produce progress , but would only produce more spending , indicates an interest in and a concern for your problems - and I pledge to you that I will always have that concern in the years ahead . Now , if I could turn to one other issue , an issue of tremendous importance , an issue of overriding importance , I should say , in this campaign and for the whole world , what could be more important than a job ? What could be more important than adequate security and adequate pension ? What could be more important than good medical care , all of these things which I stand for and for which I have programs that I believe are far superior to my opponent 's : Well , being around to enjoy our good life in this country is more important than that . I have traveled a great deal , as you know perhaps , in the last 7 ½ years .	Kennedy_November_5_1960	Nixon_November_4_1960
0048	medical care,health care	attack	And to meet the pressing problem confronting men past working age , and their families , we must put through an effective program of medical care for the aged under the social security system . The present medical care program will not send one penny to needy persons without further action by the Congress and the State legislatures . It imposes an ugly needs test-a  pauper 's oath  - for eligibility .	We believe this is the American way to handle this problem . Now , some people might say ,  But , Mr. Nixon , wo n't it be easier to have it the other way ? Wo n't it be easier just to have the Federal Government take this thing over rather than to have a Federal - State program ? Wo n't it be easier not to bother with private health insurance programs ?  Yes ; it would be easier , a lot simpler , but , my friends , you would destroy the standard of medical care because , remember , we have the best medical care in the world today .

After all , you elect a President , a Vice President , a Congressman and a Senator ; and the House and Senate meet and decisions are made , but you think , really , that is n't nearly as important as what happens to the prices in the grocery store , to what happens to your schools , to what happens to your medical care , to what happens in all the other fields I could mention . Let me say this , my friends : Today what happens in Washington will affect the prices of everything you buy at the grocery store .	Who are the people that are hit ? No.1, those who are retired , those who live on an average of $ 72 a month under social security . When we put forward a proposal this summer to provide medical care for the aged tied to social security , we had one Republican vote in the Senate , and when the vote was announced Time magazine said Mr. Nixon turned and smiled . He will not be smiling on November 8. [ Applause .	Nixon_October_27_1960	Kennedy_October_27_1960
0051	medical care,health care	attack	Here it is On these matters my opponent is all talk and no performance . Last August he was unable to lead even a 2-to-1 congressional majority to do a single thing he wanted done in the area of medical care for the aged , or any other field where he took a prominent role . Moreover , what he really stands for is a deep cut in the buying power of your social security benefits because his platform and promises will bring on another round of ruinous inflation .	Now , if they get sick , if the husband gets sick or the wife gets sick , maybe sick for 3 or 4 months , they run up doctors ' bills and medical bills in the hundreds of dollars , they have to rely on their savings or they have to rely on their children , and sometimes their children are already hard pressed to maintain their own families . What we suggest is that medical care for the aged be tied to social security , every working American contribute , and it 's little less than 3 cents a day during their working years . Then when they 're retired , they can draw on this fund and they can sustain themselves and meet their responsibilities .	Nixon_November_3_1960	Kennedy_November_2_1960
0052	medical care,health care	no_relation	We say that in the field of education we are proud that we stand for a program that will build more schools , that will raise the levels of our teachers ' salaries , but which rejects the program that they have that would endanger the right of the States to control education and that would , in effect , give to the Federal government the power not only to pay teachers , but to tell them what to teach - and that must never happen in the United States of America . We say that the answer to the problem of health care for our old people is our way and not theirs . Why ? Because ours is a program which leaves to the individual the choice , the choice of what he wants in the way of protection .	The Lincoln tradition is not found in a man who considers $ 1.25 minimum wage to be , and I quote him  extreme .  The Lincoln tradition of courage [ applause ] is not found in a man who considers Federal aid for education and teachers salaries to be  extreme ,  and I quote him accurately , and who calls helping our older citizens through the medium of social security to provide medical care for their aged life - who considers that to be  extreme .

0054	medical care,health care	attack	I know that as my mother and father reached their seventies they had some difficult times because of illness , and I know that there 's nothing that touches the hearts of children more than to think of their parents and the problems that they have then . That 's one of the reasons why we have a program in the field of medical care for the older citizens - not one like our opponents ' that would n't take care of 3 million of the people who do n't happen to be on social security , but one that will give an opportunity for every older person in this country who wants health insurance coverage to have it . , but which will require nobody to have it against his will .	You can not possibly tell me that we are going to win this competition with Mr. Khrushchev in the future when 20 or 25 percent of our capacity is unused , when 4 ½ million Americans are out of work , when 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls graduating from high school never see the inside of a college , and 16 million Americans live on an average social security check of less than $ 72 a month . And this administration says , when we try to provide aid to education , when we try to provide medical care for the aged , it is too extreme . When we try to pass $ 1.25 minimum wage , per hour , $ 50 a week [ applause ] $ 50 a week , Mr. Nixon says it is extreme .	Nixon_October_28_1960	Kennedy_October_28_1960
0055	medical care,health care	no_relation	Medical costs have increased 20 percent in the past 8 years and these rising costs have had their greatest impact on the millions of Americans who are forced to get by on an average social security check of $ 72 a month . Americans feel obliged to help their older parents receive needed medical care but the burden of this obligation strains family incomes to the breaking point . To meet this distress , the Democrats proposed that the medical expenses of retired Americans be financed through the social security system .	And now , if I could spell it out in two or three directions . First , let 's take this problem of medical care for the aged . It 's one that is very close to my heart .

This year again Mr. Nixon , as the spokesman for his party , speaking to 73 million people in our television debate , said that our efforts to provide medical care through social security were  extreme .  But I do n't believe it is  extreme  to help our older citizens get the medical attention they need .	Hospitals ? We have built more hospitals in this 7 years than in the preceding 7 years . Health ?

0057	medical care,health care	no_relation	The kind of a meeting that we had today indicates , I think , that partnership which can exist between the farmers of this country and the Federal Government . Senator John F. Kennedy tonight expressed keen disappointment on the defeat of the Anderson - Kennedy amendment to the medical care to the aged bill .  I am sure that the threat of a White House veto mentioned by every speaker opposing the amendment contributed to this defeat .	Let me speak now of a more important issue . I am sure when you heard the words  more important  some of you thought :  What could be more important than education for our children , a better job , adequate hospitals and health care , all these things that I have mentioned ?  The answer is :  We can have the best social security system , the best education , the best jobs that we can imagine , and it is not going to do any good unless we are around to enjoy them .  So I urge all of you , without regard to your partisan affiliations , to have this major issue in mind as you go to the polls on election day :  Which of the two candidates , which of the two tickets , do you believe best provides the kind of leadership that will keep the peace for America and keep it without a surrender of principle ?  Here we think we have a good record .	Kennedy_August_23_1960	Nixon_August_17_1960
0058	medical care,health care	attack	My opponent says the thing to do is to have the Federal Government take over and to force everybody , except for 3 million who need it the most , into a system of compulsory health insurance whether they want it or not over 65 . You know what my program is ? I say that every person over 65 who ought to have health insurance , who wants it , should be able to get it and the Federal Government should set up a program so they should be able to afford it ; second , that everybody who ought to have it should be encouraged to get it , but I also say that no one who does not want health insurance should be forced to have it against his will , so that we can maintain the private system in this country which is essential for medical care . So much for these two examples .	[ Applause . ] And this job will not be finished until we provide medical care for the aged under social security . Finally , let me say that I am glad to be here with a young and progressive figure from the State of Michigan , who I believe will succeed Mennen Williams as a great Governor , who will lead Michigan forward - John Swainson .

Now , you have to decide which party and which candidate based on their history , based on their statements in this campaign , based on their look into the future , can lead this country into the dangerous years of the 1960 's , which party and which candidate and which viewpoint can build in this country a strong society which will serve as an inspiration to the people around the world .

It is no accident that 400,000 people in a rich State like Pennsylvania wait every month for surplus food packages from the Federal Government .	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage .

If you raise the minimum wage , in my opinion - and all the experts confirm this that I have talked to in the Government - above $ 1.15 , it would mean unemployment ; unemployment , because there are many industries that could not pay more than $ 1.15 without cutting down their work force ; $ 1.15 can be absorbed , and then at a later time we could move to $ 1.25 as the economy moves up .	Mr. Nixon represents a party which has opposed progress - for many years .

He represents a party which has opposed the strengthening of our educational system , which has opposed medical care for our older citizens tied to social security , which has brought recession in 1954 , again in 1958 , and has brought us to an economic slowdown in the vital year of 1960 .

All through the campaign my opponent has been trumpeting the falsehood that I , in effect , feast on human misery - that I oppose minimum wage , help to distressed areas , social security , medical care for the aged , and all else that concerns the good of the American people . Last week Mr. Kennedy called me the leader of the social security wrecking crew - trying to secure votes from the aged by playing on their fears .	 Today the Fair Labor Standards Act , with its guarantee of a decent minimum wage , has become an established feature of the American economic System but in 1937 a leading Republican Congressman warned that  if you pass this bill * * * gone with the wind is our democratic system of government and all the institutions we hold dear .  Other Republicans attacked minimum wage as  communism  and the  road to economic hell  - 93 percent of the Republicans in Congress voted to kill the bill calling for a 25-cent minimum wage and the Republicans have opposed every increase in the minimum wage ever since . Today the Social Security Act is regarded as the most important and beneficial single piece of social legislation in American history .	Nixon_November_3_1960	Kennedy_October_30_1960
0076	minimum wage	no_relation	You have the Kennedy bill , which would raise the minimum wage on a graduated basis to a dollar and a quarter in 3 years , and which would expand coverage to 5 million people not presently covered . You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase . It takes coverage away from some .	These changes in employment can hardly be attributed to the statutory increase but it is interesting to note that 3 years after the statutory increase employment in the same communities had risen 20 percent in the industries subject to the act and only 14 percent in those outside the statute . In short , the Labor Department 's study fully supports the conclusion that the 1955 minimum wage increase did not result in any substantial changes for the Nation in either price levels or employment . The increases now proposed can have no greater impact .	Nixon_August_13_1960	Kennedy_August_10_1960

For I believe that the American people are going to reject a party which - again in Mr. Nixon 's words - believes that  unemployment is inevitable ,  a party which lacks faith in the capacity of a strong and growing America to provide jobs for all its people , a party which , in the most fundamental sense , is letting America run down because it is failing to build America up , a party whose candidate is all too ready to threaten war but is unwilling to build up the strength which is the only guarantee of peace , who is always willing to speak loudly , but is unwilling to be sure that America carries a big stick .

The Republicans adopted the seemingly simple and easy policy of tightening interest rates when demand was strong and prices were rising - a principle that requires allowing rates to fall when the economy needed stimulation .

Why ,  they say ,  could n't we just do it ? Would n't that be real leadership in the world ? Would n't that be bold and imaginative ?  Yes , it would ; but do you know what would happen ? The moment the United States ever enters into an agreement for disarmament , which would result in increasing his strength as against ours , we do n't help the cause of peace . We hurt it , because - why is America the guardian of peace today ? Because we 're the strongest nation in the world , and the difference is : We do n't want to use our strength for anything except to keep the peace .	And we cared so little about arms control , that we regarded the entire effort as just another branch of psychological warfare , restricting ourselves to propaganda while Soviet armed strength increased . At the London Conference of 1957 - the first important disarmament meeting , we were represented by a man with absolutely no experience in arms control , Harold Stassen , and we sent him to the meeting without having formulated any American position . It was not until August 29 , 1957 , more than 5 months after the conference opened , that America had any position at all .	Nixon_October_25_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960

Four-fifths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives , including the Congressman of this district , who is chairman of the congressional committee for all Republicans , voted against the $ 1.25 minimum wage for a 40-hour week , not for a business which is only ten , fifteen , or twenty-five thousand dollars a year , but for a business which makes more than $ 1 million a year , we wanted to pay them $ 1.25 by 1962 , not this year , but 1962 , and to pay those that were not covered by 1964 $ 1.25 , and four-fifths of the Republicans voted against it .	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .

0113	disarmament	attack	In other words , disarmament without inspection increases the risk of war . It 's only disarmament with inspection that will reduce the risk of war . So , I pledge to you that , with my colleague , Cabot Lodge , to whom I am going to give special assignments in this field , we will take the initiative at every opportunity to deal with Mr. Khrushchev and to work out whatever arrangement we can that will provide inspection for disarmament , for tests , for all these other items which I am discussing tonight .	We have never adopted a comprehensive and meaningful position , and we have too often resorted instead to irresponsible grandstand plays . I have proposed a national peace agency , an arms control research institute , to prepare those studies necessary for a firm and precise policy , to make certain our spokesmen are better prepared and better staffed at future conferences , to enable us to seize the disarmament initiative . For I know we can do better .	Nixon_November_3_1960	Kennedy_November_2_1960
0115	medical care,health care	no_relation	Some of you may raise a question here when I say this is the most important issue , but I am sure when you consider it you will agree with me . Other issues are important - whether or not we have a good job , the kind of social security that we have for our old age , the kind of medical care that we get , the development of the right kind of school system and all the other things in which all Americans are interested , but you know , we can have the best social security , the best housing , the best jobs that we could possibly imagine , and it is n't going to make any difference if we 're not around to enjoy them . So , this is the issue of our time .	The man and party who oppose a decent minimum wage also oppose decent wages for our teachers . The man and the party who oppose medical care for the aged have no more compassion for the small farmer or the small businessman , or hungry families here in the United States or around the world . That kind of man and that kind of party likes things the way they are .	Nixon_September_13_1960	Kennedy_September_5_1960
0117	disarmament	attack	The struggle for disarmament will not be an easy one . For disarmament is an ideal just as peace itself is an ideal , but it was a great son of Wisconsin , Carl Schurz , who said : Ideals are like stars ; you will not succeed in touching them with your hands . But , like the seafaring man on the desert of waters , you choose them as your guides , and following them you will reach your destiny .	I see him , ruthless , tough , completely a man dedicated to one purpose only - the evil purpose of conquering the world , and this is what I know . If America ever makes the mistake of entering into a disarmament agreement , which he does not also keep with inspection , it will increase the danger of war rather than reduce it , and I 'll tell you why : We can not leave to a man who is the enemy of peace power to start a war and destroy the world . We have to have the power because we are friends of peace .	Kennedy_October_23_1960	Nixon_October_22_1960
0118	disarmament	support	And I say that we can not and should not blame ourselves , our policies , our negotiators , their scientific advisers , or their instructions , for the unyielding refusal of the Soviets to make an agreement at Geneva . The time and patience which we have already expended to explore this way out of the disarmament dilemma have been full proof of our own intentions and those of the Soviets . The blame rests squarely on them .	We can not parley on the basis of equality with the Soviet unless we maintain a military position of equality with them , and that goes in the traditional weapons and in missiles and in outer space . One of the reasons why we have never been able to get an agreement on the disarmament of outer space is because we are second in outer space , and the Soviet Union will not give way their advantage . We arm to parley , and we must be strong if we are going to disarm and maintain our security .	Nixon_October_26_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
0119	medical care,health care	no_relation	We want to move forward . We want better schools , and better housing , better medical care for our children than we had for ourselves . Here in the West we want to develop our tremendous natural resources through reclamation projects .	[ Applause . ] And I could not leave here today , this great source of national strength here in Warm Springs , without reminding all of us that there is still unfinished business before us in the health field , that there are still over 18 million Americans over the age of 65 who live out their lives without assistance , without a recognition of the great problems that they face in the field of health , and I believe it incumbent upon the next Congress and the next administration to permit them to participate in the development of a trust fund which will provide protection in their old age without their having to take , as they now take , a pauper 's oath before they can receive medical assistance and medical care . [ Applause .	Nixon_October_11_1960	Kennedy_October_10_1960
0121	disarmament	attack	And the Soviet Union has consistently had the initiative in the eyes of the world . At a time when our relative military strength was much higher than it is today , from 1953-55 , there was not a single top person in the entire Government working full time on disarmament . We did not come up with a single major new proposal for arms control .	We know what peace demands . We will always go the extra mile to strengthen peace , the extra mile to work for disarmament , the extra mile to reduce tensions , but we will always remember that the man we are dealing with and his colleagues are ruthless , fanatical aggressors and that they do not follow the rules of the game that we would like them to follow , and that we must treat them the way they are , and this means that we must never make a concession without being sure that we 're getting one in return , that we must never agree , for example , to disarmament unless we can be sure that they , too , are disarming . Why is this necessary for peace ? Because , as I said at my last stop , we 've got to remember that as long as the United States maintains its present position of being stronger than anyone who threatens the peace of the world we can be the guardians of peace ; but the moment that somebody or some nation that does not want peace - in other words , that would use war as an instrument of conquest - is stronger than we are , or thinks they are , then peace is no longer safe .

0122	unemployment	attack	Listening to the opposition , one would never know that there are almost 68 million Americans at work in our $ 500 billion economy and that Americans are earning at a record annual rate of over $ 408 billion . One will never learn from my opponent that employment declined less than seasonally last month and that unemployment went down more than seasonally . Unemployment dropped not only as to number but also as a percentage of the labor force .	But this would be basically true regardless of who wins . No President - Democratic or Republican - will be satisfied with growing unemployment , lagging economic growth or excessive price inflation that adversely affects our trade with other nations as well as our stability here at home . And both candidates are also equally opposed to excessive , unjustified or unnecessary government intervention in the economy - to needlessly unbalanced budgets and centralized government .	Nixon_October_19_1960	Kennedy_October_12_1960
0123	minimum wage	attack	I run against a candidate and a party which has opposed in the last 25 years every piece of progressive legislation put forward . Minimum wage - Mr. Nixon 's Republican Party voted 90 percent against a 25-cent minimum wage in the midthirties , and they voted 90 percent against the $ 1.25 in 1960 . They voted 90 percent against social security in the midthirties , and they voted 90 percent against the medical care for the aged tied to social security in 1960 .	The misstatement : In the second debate Senator Kennedy said : The Republicans in recent years , not only in the last 25 years , but in the last 8 years , have opposed * * * minimum wage * * The facts : Senator Kennedy is saying that Republicans who opposed his particular bill are against minimum wage . The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve . In 1960 , this administration sought to extend minimum wage coverage to 3.1 million additional workers and indicated support of an increase in the minimum wage to $ 1.15 per hour .

0125	unemployment	attack	 This letter from this 12-year-old boy sums up the concern that I found all over the United States as we have traveled this country north , east , west , and south . This concern and the idea that this is the major of this campaign is held not only by Republicans but by Democrats and independents , and I find that as far as this particular issue is concerned , it transcends all the rest , because while people , of course , are interested in how government can provide the climate in which we can continue to have good jobs and high wages and how government can provide the necessary procedures through which we can have social security in times of unemployment and better schools and hospitals - while they are interested in these things , they know it does n't make any difference if we had all those things if we are not around to enjoy them . I say to you the biggest , major issue which we should talk about today above all others is this : Which of the two candidates for the Vice Presidency and the Presidency can best provide the leadership for America and the free world in these next 4 years which will keep the peace without surrender and which will extend the freedom throughout the world .	You won a great victory 2 years ago here in California , and this State is going to lead the way to another great victory exactly 2 months from tonight . Pat Brown , working with a Democratic legislature , has written human rights into California law - broader unemployment compensation . More help for the aged and needy .	Nixon_September_15_1960	Kennedy_September_8_1960
0126	minimum wage	support	A shift of four or five votes in the House last June would have enacted a real minimum wage bill , with coverage for several million more families and a minimum of $ 1.25 an hour . Next January we will have those votes - and you will have a President who knows what a strong minimum wage law means to stop runaway shops and to raise living standards . I ask you also to elect John Swainson as Governor of Michigan - a great Governor to succeed a great Governor .	You have the Kennedy bill , which would raise the minimum wage on a graduated basis to a dollar and a quarter in 3 years , and which would expand coverage to 5 million people not presently covered . You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase . It takes coverage away from some .	Kennedy_September_5_1960	Nixon_August_13_1960
0127	medical care,health care	attack	We believe this is the American way to handle this problem . Now , some people might say ,  But , Mr. Nixon , wo n't it be easier to have it the other way ? Wo n't it be easier just to have the Federal Government take this thing over rather than to have a Federal - State program ? Wo n't it be easier not to bother with private health insurance programs ?  Yes ; it would be easier , a lot simpler , but , my friends , you would destroy the standard of medical care because , remember , we have the best medical care in the world today . We do n't want to destroy it , and speaking here in Rochester , Minn .	[ Applause . ] I do n't believe that the American people are going to give their endorsement to the leadership which believes that medical care for our older citizens , financed under social security , is extreme , and I quote Mr. Nixon accurately - which he does not always do me . [ Applause .	Nixon_October_8_1960	Kennedy_October_6_1960
0128	disarmament	no_relation	Today you are threatening or encouraging further disorders in Latin America , Africa , southeast Asia , Germany , and the Middle East . You have defied and hamstrung the U.N., yet now you come talking of disarmament . Under the old English legal maxim ,  He who seeks equity must come with clean hands .	I 'm confident of what America can do in the years ahead , provided that Americans know the problems , face up to the challenge , and stay true to the principles that have made this country great . Now , if I might turn to one other point that I think should be covered on an occasion like this , what should be our diplomatic policy in these years ahead ? Diplomatically , the United States , as the President indicated at Baltimore this morning , must always be ready and willing to sit down at the conference table and discuss disarmament , to discuss any differences that we have with any other nation in the world , because we must work for peace constantly ; but on the other hand , let 's remember , as the President also said this morning , when it comes to disarmament we must never forget that we can take nothing on faith , because America must never give up any of its own strength unless we know that the potential enemies of freedom and of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time . In other words , we can have disarmament only with inspection , with the guarantees which the President has insisted upon and which we will insist upon in the next administration as well .	Kennedy_September_16_1960	Nixon_September_12_1960
0129	medical care,health care	no_relation	This fight is important , because unless this country is moving ahead , this country will not lead a world which is moving ahead . The same political party , the Republicans , who could vote against social security in the thirties could vote unanimously against the medical care for the aged in the sixties . The same political party that could vote against the minimum wage of 25 cents an hour in 1935 could vote against $ 1.25 an hour in 1960 , and this goes to the heart of the issue , a party which fights progress , a party which is not prepared to associate with it , a party which has stood athwart the great social , international , and national movements of this century , sponsored by Wilson and Roosevelt and Truman - how can they lead in the dangerous sixties ? How can they lead and move this country forward ? How can they demonstrate to a watching world that we are a strong and vital society ? In outer space , in the world around us , in Latin America , in Africa , in Asia , in Wisconsin , we are associated with a forward motion and they have stood still , and I believe on November 8 , the people of this country are going to choose to move again .	The purpose of our program is to provide equal opportunity for every American to better himself , to free life more and more from the stunting effect of economic need , and we seek to make it possible for every individual in this Nation to be somebody , to have something . Now , going along with this faith in the individual as an abiding concern , a concern for his problems as a human being - the possible loss of a job and livelihood through no fault of his own when the economy changes ; the fear that the end of his working years may mean poverty , that the loss of a breadwinner may mean destitution for the widow and children ; the cost of medical care in old age : These are some of the searing human concerns that our program aims to minimize through effective private and public measures . Such efforts toward personal security , first , are right - not only from the humanitarian viewpoint , which all of us will understand ; they are mandatory if our complex modern society is to work at its best , at its fullest .	Kennedy_October_23_1960	Nixon_October_20_1960
0130	medical care,health care	attack	First of all , can anyone in this square tell me one piece of progressive legislation sponsored by Mr. Nixon or the Republican Party ? [ Response from the audience . ] That is the party which voted 90 percent against social security in the midthirties , voted 90 percent against medical care for the aged in 1960 . Mr. Nixon represents a party which voted 95 percent against tlie 25-cent minimum wage in the thirties .	Schools will he built . We have a program in the field of medical care . We have a program in the field of housing .	Kennedy_November_1_1960	Nixon_October_31_1960
0132	medical care,health care	no_relation	[ Applause . ] Third , we want to keep it the best medical care in the world . We want to give to our people .	Mr. Nixon believes a housing bill which will build homes for our people is extreme . Mr. Nixon believes that medical care for our older citizens tied to social security is extreme . We disagree on the goals of our country and we disagree on the means of attaining these goals .	Nixon_October_17_1960	Kennedy_October_17_1960
0133	unemployment	support	They would have thought of the people and we would have had a bill that would have done something about it . I say to you today , and I pledge to you , that America , first , can not afford to allow any pockets of unemployment to exist . We can not afford not to use the tremendous human resources that are here in this area that are not being used .	Throughout the entire Nation men and women - almost 4 million of them - are looking for jobs . Economists tell us that an unemployment rate of 6 percent is the danger signal . When a community passes that point it is officially regarded as an area of  substantial labor surplus .	Nixon_September_19_1960	Kennedy_September_19_1960
0134	minimum wage	attack	We are going to have , by the middle of November , 1 million unsold cars , the highest inventory of unsold cars in the history of the United States . Now , anyone who believes that under those conditions we should continue that kind of leadership , that supports leadership that twice , not once , but twice vetoed the area redevelopment bill , sponsored by your Congressman , Dan Flood , and your Senator , Joe Clark - anyone that believes that a minimum wage of $ 1.25 is extreme , Mr. Nixon is your man . But anyone who believes as I do that this country will never be strong in the world , that we will never be successful in turning Mr. Khrushchev back , we will never be successful in expanding freedom around the world unless we have in this country a strong and vital and progressive society , and that is what we are committed to , that is what we are committed to , and I believe the American people on November 8 , faced with a choice of a leadership that looks to the past and the present , and recognizing that this country , the only hope of freedom that there is , we are the only sentinel at the gate , and if we do n't move ahead , if we do n't provide employment for our people , if we do n't use our facilities to the fullest , if we do n't educate our children and provide under social security medical care for our aged and jobs for those in between , then the United States , instead of being the leader of the free world , will cease to count as the only hope of freedom .	The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve . In 1960 , this administration sought to extend minimum wage coverage to 3.1 million additional workers and indicated support of an increase in the minimum wage to $ 1.15 per hour . The misstatement : In the first debate Senator Kennedy said that the Republican Party gives only  lipservice  to programs of medical care for the aged .	Kennedy_October_28_1960	Nixon_October_19_1960
0135	disarmament	attack	Nixon , why does n't the United States show a more flexible attitude ? Why do n't we take the first step toward disarmament ?  Let me tell you what we have done . We have not only taken one step ; we have not only taken two steps , but we have gone the second mile , the third mile , way down the line on disarmament . The point is : the Soviet Union is blocking the road to disarmament , blocking the road to stopping tests .	He prepared a report . The report was thrown aside , and this time a New York lawyer without any experience in the field of disarmament became head of our mission . We had no position and we adopted that of the British .	Nixon_October_27_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
0137	unemployment	attack	But we can always do better and I am determined that we shall do better in quickening the pace of our economic advance and in minimizing interruptions to it . I am determined to undertake every sensible measure to that end , to lift to ever higher levels the number of jobs in America , to reduce unemployment further , and to utilize more fully our industrial capacity in steel and other lines To achieve that goal we must release fully the greatest creative force in human affairs - the spirit of individual enterprise in 180 million Americans . That effort calls for a many-sided program which I have been developing , and will continue to develop , in this campaign .	[ Applause . ] Can you possibly say that our power is increasing when you know that next winter and next spring the United States will face a most serious crisis over Berlin at a time when our strength is not rising in relation to that of the Communists ? Do you feel that this administration has solved the problem of unemployment , when we have more people out of work now , this fall , than any time except for the three postwar recessions ? Do you feel that your children are going to get jobs when you realize that we have to find 25,000 new jobs a week for the next 10 years in order to provide employment for our people ? I believe this country can meet its responsibilities , to its own citizens and those around the world , but I think we have to do better than we are doing and that is the issue . Do you agree ? I think you do .	Nixon_October_19_1960	Kennedy_October_16_1960
0138	disarmament	no_relation	The catastrophic arms race , more costly than all of our budget put together , more costly than all the other things which we pay for , can not be eliminated merely by wishful thinking . But is n't it a somber fact that this administration has had less than 100 people working in the entire National Government on the subject of disarmament One-fifth as many as work for the U.S. Battle Monuments Commission are working on disarmament in this administration - 100 people scattered throughout the international government . And we can not avoid the menace of a Communist base on Cuba , only 90 miles from our shores , merely by wishing it had not happened , though I wish it had not .	And now we come to the key question , and one again I want to talk to you very frankly about . Is there any chance - is there any chance - that Mr. Khrushchev will ever agree unless we do agree to give him what he wants , and that is disarmament without inspection ? And my answer is : Yes ; I believe so . I believe so , my friends , because Mr. Khrushchev , above everything else , is no fool .	Kennedy_November_4_1960	Nixon_November_3_1960
0139	medical care,health care	no_relation	I refer , of course , to the Social Security Act of 1935 . It is particularly appropriate that we mark that anniversary by the extension of the system to include medical care insurance for our older citizens . A quarter of a century ago , the people of the United States turned their back on the dole and the means test , and chose instead to rely on self-financed insurance , paid through the social security system , to protect themselves against the hazards of old age .	Let me speak now of a more important issue . I am sure when you heard the words  more important  some of you thought :  What could be more important than education for our children , a better job , adequate hospitals and health care , all these things that I have mentioned ?  The answer is :  We can have the best social security system , the best education , the best jobs that we can imagine , and it is not going to do any good unless we are around to enjoy them .  So I urge all of you , without regard to your partisan affiliations , to have this major issue in mind as you go to the polls on election day :  Which of the two candidates , which of the two tickets , do you believe best provides the kind of leadership that will keep the peace for America and keep it without a surrender of principle ?  Here we think we have a good record .	Kennedy_August_23_1960	Nixon_August_17_1960
0142	medical care,health care	no_relation	It is a view sharply in contrast with the charity approach , or the demeaning consignment of the aged as dependent burdens upon their families and public relief . The clearest evidence of this difference in approach can be seen in the problem of health care for the aged . Some of the proposals have been founded upon a degrading means test .	I 'm speaking of the average family . We also want better medical care for our older people , and for all of us as well . We want other things .	Kennedy_October_12_1960	Nixon_October_10_1960
0143	disarmament	no_relation	Halt the arms race .  Let me tell you about disarmament . When people say ,  I 'm for disarmament ,  and when some people write to me and say  Why , when Mr. Khrushchev comes over and says he 's for total disarmament - why do we have to insist on inspection ? Why ,  they say ,  could n't we just do it ? Would n't that be real leadership in the world ? Would n't that be bold and imaginative ?  Yes , it would ; but do you know what would happen ? The moment the United States ever enters into an agreement for disarmament , which would result in increasing his strength as against ours , we do n't help the cause of peace .	I want to make it clear that I come to this section of Wisconsin to ask your support in this campaign with the full realization that the responsibility and burdens of the Presidency will be greater than they have ever been in the past . The whole spread of atomic weapons , the whole subject of disarmament , the whole crisis over Berlin which will hit this country and Western Germany hard next winter and next spring , the problems in the Far East , the maintenance of freedom in Latin America and Africa and Asia , the maintenance of full employment here in this section of Wisconsin , which depends on the paper industry , the maintenance of full employment in Pennsylvania which depends on an outgoing steel industry , the maintenance of full employment in West Virginia and Kentucky , which depend on coal - all these burdens will fall upon the desk of the next President of the United States . The tremendous revolution in agriculture , which has provided a great increase in the production of food and a sharp decrease in farm income - all these will come to rest upon the desk of the next President of the United States .	Nixon_October_25_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
0146	medical care,health care	attack	I made no reference to his vote on teachers ' salaries . He did not vote on medical care for the aged . I do n't intend to make any reference to it .	I believe that the most effective method is through a program which will provide a choice whereby people who want to have the protection for catastrophic illnesses or , for that matter , for noncatastrophic illnesses , if they so desire , can have it , but where they are not forced to have it if they do not desire , and where they can choose getting that protection through government or through private plans , which they might choose , with some government assistance . And I would agree with Senator Kennedy , incidentally , to this extent : he indicated that this would be an issue in the campaign , I think it will be an issue in the campaign , and the question will not be one of ends , because both of us believe that there should he protection for our older citizens for medical care . The question will be one of means .	Kennedy_September_7_1960	Nixon_August_24_1960
0147	minimum wage	attack	[ Applause . ] Here in the State of Michigan , in this great industrial State , it is between those who are the leaders of the Republican Party who have spilled this country into three recessions in the last 8 years , who have opposed every piece of progressive legislation for the benefit of our people , for care to the aged , employment for our people , minimum wage , education for our children , better opportunity for all of our citizens , it is between that group on the one hand and those who want to pick this country up and move it forward on the other . [ Applause .	Meanwhile , the contradictory statements of Senator Kennedy still leave him opposed to this position . The misstatement : In the second debate Senator Kennedy said : The Republicans in recent years , not only in the last 25 years , but in the last 8 years , have opposed * * * minimum wage * * The facts : Senator Kennedy is saying that Republicans who opposed his particular bill are against minimum wage . The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve .	Kennedy_October_26_1960	Nixon_October_19_1960
0148	disarmament	attack	For the hopes of all mankind rest on successful disarmament . And if we let the nations of Africa and Asia and Latin America feel that the United States is the real obstacle to disarmament , that we are not sincere in our desire for peace - if we continue to let the Soviet Union seize the offensive in disarmament negotiations - then these emerging areas of the world may well turn away from America and the free world , and begin to look to the Communist bloc for leadership in the fight for peace . And , of course , we must also seek disarmament because the only alternative to pursuit of an effective disarmament agreement is the pursuit of our present course - the arms race , the gap , new weapons , the development of even higher orders of mutual terror resulting in the ever higher likelihood of mutual destruction .	I see him , ruthless , tough , completely a man dedicated to one purpose only - the evil purpose of conquering the world , and this is what I know . If America ever makes the mistake of entering into a disarmament agreement , which he does not also keep with inspection , it will increase the danger of war rather than reduce it , and I 'll tell you why : We can not leave to a man who is the enemy of peace power to start a war and destroy the world . We have to have the power because we are friends of peace .	Kennedy_October_23_1960	Nixon_October_22_1960
0149	minimum wage	no_relation	The Republican program in education , unlike Mr. Kennedy 's would provide funds for school construction which would enable State and local districts to use their money for raising teachers salaries , without involving the Government in the direct payment of teachers salaries which would lead toward dictation from Washington as to what is taught in our schools to our children . It is a matter of record that Republicans have extended social security and strengthened minimum wage legislation . Moreover , we care too much for people to advocate programs , as my opponent does , which would raise Federal spending by over $ 15 billion a year - programs so great they could be paid for , not out of miracles of economic growth , but by 180 million Americans in higher taxes and higher prices .	I believe the American people prefer their experience under the Democratic Party . Our experience is written in the Social Security Act , the minimum wage laws , the FHA , the REA , guaranteed bank deposits , TVA and a host of other programs . The Bible tells us that  whatsoever a man soweth , that shall he also reap .	Nixon_October_29_1960	Kennedy_October_24_1960
0150	minimum wage	no_relation	Now , let 's look very practically at what happened in the last session of the Congress - this so-called Kennedy - Johnson session . They had a minimum wage bill in that session of the Congress . They rejected this bill , which could have passed , and they tried of course to get through a bill which would have extended coverage to more people and which would have raised the minimum to $ 1.15 this year and to $ 1.25 next year .	I just do n't believe that the 1960 's is a time to stand still . Every piece of important legislation of benefit to our people was opposed by the Republicans when they first came into being , away back to the Federal Reserve Board , all the reforms of the Roosevelt administration , social security , all the others , minimum wage , housing , benefits to the farmers , all opposed . Now , with that long history , TVA , the development of our resources , all in opposition , with that long history , how can we expect that that party and that candidate can move this country ahead , with all the changes coming on , the prospects for unemployment , the recession possibly this winter in 1961 , with our farm income down 25 percent , with 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls never seeing the inside of a college , who graduate from high school , our prestige in the world being affected , with Communists on the march , Castro on the march .

0151	minimum wage	attack	And it was extreme for Mr. Nixon . For he had previously voted to completely remove 1 million workers from the protection of the minimum wage laws and he is the candidate of a party which opposed the first 25-cent-an-hour minimum wage and which has fought against every increase since . 2. The job-price squeeze has also frustrated the ambitions of millions of Americans to buy their own homes .	The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve . In 1960 , this administration sought to extend minimum wage coverage to 3.1 million additional workers and indicated support of an increase in the minimum wage to $ 1.15 per hour .

It is our responsibility to bring those programs , extension of the right to vote , civil rights , minimum wage , housing , education , to increase the opportunity for all Americans to share in the abundance . And I do not share the view of the Vice President that these programs are extreme ; $ 1.25 minimum wage , not this year , not until 1962 , for those people already covered , not until 1964 for the newly covered , and still that bill was voted against by 75 to 80 percent of the Members of the House of Representatives who are Republicans .

The point is : the Soviet Union is blocking the road to disarmament , blocking the road to stopping tests . Why ? Because they want a closed society and they want no inspection .	And this administration has failed to recognize the decisive nature of what science is doing to our hopes for the future . This administration has had less than 100 people working in the entire national administration on the subject of disarmament . We have gone into every conference unprepared .

0156	minimum wage	no_relation	I am most grateful to Senator Morse for his wire . He and I worked closely together in the Congress in this last session to secure the passage of a bill providing $ 1.25 minimum wage . We failed , but I think that we have a chance in this campaign to discuss these issues , to discuss our failures and the reasons for them , and go to the people and ask them to make a decision , ask them to give us a mandate to move this country ahead on all of the great fronts which are traditional , I think , in the Democratic Party .	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .

0159	minimum wage	attack	Now , let 's look very practically at what happened in the last session of the Congress - this so-called Kennedy - Johnson session . They had a minimum wage bill in that session of the Congress . They rejected this bill , which could have passed , and they tried of course to get through a bill which would have extended coverage to more people and which would have raised the minimum to $ 1.15 this year and to $ 1.25 next year .	[ Response from the audience . ] Mr. Nixon leads a party which , in the midthirties , voted 95 percent against a 25-cent minimum wage , and he leads a party which in 1960 voted 95 percent against $ 1.25 minimum wage .

0161	minimum wage	support	I think it is a good question because it goes to the heart of the matter which I was trying to point to before . In the case of the minimum wage , we passed out of the Senate by a vote of nearly 2 to 1. That was the $ 1.25 minimum wage . Earlier , the House of Representatives passed a bill by , I think , nine votes against the $ 1.25 minimum wage , in favor of a wholly inadequate coverage under minimum wage which affected only about 1 million people .	You have the Kennedy bill , which would raise the minimum wage on a graduated basis to a dollar and a quarter in 3 years , and which would expand coverage to 5 million people not presently covered . You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase . It takes coverage away from some .	Kennedy_September_7_1960	Nixon_August_13_1960

We 're going to have to have a better program in the field of medical care , but my friends , the reason why my programs are better for America than those of my opponent is this . That his would turn all of these problems over to the Federal Government , they would cost an amount equal - get this - each year to almost the entire gold reserve of America that 's in Fort Knox , and do you know what that means to you ? It means higher prices , higher taxes for the American people .	It amounts , for a family of four people , to $ 6.50 for a family of four , which amounts to a grand total of 5 cents per person per day , in the richest country on earth . If you feel that a minimum wage of $ 1.25 is extreme , if you believe that medical care for the aged tied to social security is worse than a medical aid bill which requires that an old person must take an oath that he is medically indigent , a pauper 's oath , before he gets public assistance , if you feel it is proper to veto two depressed area bills , if you are pleased by the fact that we built this year in September 30 percent less homes than a year ago , and that this administration has vetoed two housing bills in the last 12 months , if you think that is good , Mr. Nixon is your man .

He said the Government of the United States should support the anti-Castro forces in and out of Cuba - and again I quote him exactly - and again he was wrong and the President was right , because what my opponent would have done would have violated five treaties .

That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests . Yes , but we will never agree to an agreement unless the Soviet Union is going to require inspection as well as the United States .	For peace will not come solely through the conference room and the propaganda machine . Rather the road to a world at peace runs through a revitalized and growing American economy , through the arduous construction of defenses so powerful that the Communists know that peace is their only alternative , through vast research projects to solve the complex difficulties of controlling modern arms , through carefully prepared disarmament programs to be presented by skilled and experienced negotiators , and through the exercise of a firm Presidential leadership which will never allow either our own representatives or the rest of the world to wonder what our position is , to wonder indeed , if we have any position at all , or to doubt the sincerity of our desire for disarmament .

Let 's face it : It took war to solve the unemployment riddle for them . After the war was over opposition spokesmen forecast some 6 million unemployed .	Last night , in our debate , Mr. Nixon was asked to give his program for economic growth - what he intended to do to put idle plants and idle men back to work - to move America toward new heights of production and strength - to provide new jobs for an expanding population . But Mr. Nixon had no new program , no new approach ; just the same old tired policies which have resulted in a doubling of unemployment and in a slowing down of our growth until , today , we are growing more slowly than every other industrial nation in the world - policies which have resulted in a steel industry operating at only 50 percent of capacity - an automobile industry which has laid off thousands of men - and a State of Michigan where more than 200,000 men are unemployed and which has never emerged from the Republican recession of 1958 . But the Democratic Party does have a program - a program which will reverse the downward trend of the past 8 years - which will put men back to work and move America toward new heights of productivity and abundance - which will build the stronger America on which the cause of freedom depends .

I would like to hear some new arguments .	I think , as you are aware , you actually have three bills which are potentially before the Congress . You have the Kennedy bill , which would raise the minimum wage on a graduated basis to a dollar and a quarter in 3 years , and which would expand coverage to 5 million people not presently covered .

0174	cuba	no_relation	I think the great opportunity was really denied in 1957 , during the last days of the Batista administration . I was in Cuba in 1957 and the American Ambassador informed me that the American Ambassador was the second most influential man in Cuba . There is not any doubt we had great influence in Cuba , and I think it is unfortunate that we did not use that influence more vigorously to persuade Mr. Batista to hold free , open elections , so that the people of Cuba could have made the choice , rather than holding onto his power and finally driven out by Castro at the point of a gun .	And on the other side there is the wrong and demagogic way - the right that I have pointed out , the wrong which Senator Kennedy has advocated - and I say this is a way of shooting from the hip on matters gravely affecting the security of the United States . And , so , finally , let 's look at the record , all three , the position on Quemoy and Matsu - slice off a bit of freedom ; maybe it will lead to peace ; the position on the summit conference - express regrets to Khrushchev ; maybe we can save the conference , and then this latest episode with regard to Cuba . I think when you look at these three episodes that this should convince many Americans that they could not rest well at night with a man with such a total lack of judgment as Commander in Chief of our Armed Forces in this critical period .

One ; 44 Democrats and 1 Republican . And do you know when the vote was announced , a great national magazine said ,  Mr .	They would risk the very recession that Senator Kennedy has so loosely and in a very demagogic way predicted . So I say to you that there is a way to progress , a way in which we can have better education without having Federal control of our education ; in which we can have better housing ; in which we can have improved medical care and medical care and insurance for our older people without socializing the medical institutions in this country , without compelling people to have health insurance unless they want it and giving them a choice , which is the American way of doing it ; a program in which we can have progress in civil rights , which will move forward from the area in which we are presently finding ourselves .

It is a matter of record that Republicans have extended social security and strengthened minimum wage legislation . Moreover , we care too much for people to advocate programs , as my opponent does , which would raise Federal spending by over $ 15 billion a year - programs so great they could be paid for , not out of miracles of economic growth , but by 180 million Americans in higher taxes and higher prices .	In 1935 , 90 percent of the Republicans voted against social security . In 1937 and 1938 , 90 percent of the Republicans voted against the 25-cent minimum wage .

This concern and the idea that this is the major of this campaign is held not only by Republicans but by Democrats and independents , and I find that as far as this particular issue is concerned , it transcends all the rest , because while people , of course , are interested in how government can provide the climate in which we can continue to have good jobs and high wages and how government can provide the necessary procedures through which we can have social security in times of unemployment and better schools and hospitals - while they are interested in these things , they know it does n't make any difference if we had all those things if we are not around to enjoy them . I say to you the biggest , major issue which we should talk about today above all others is this : Which of the two candidates for the Vice Presidency and the Presidency can best provide the leadership for America and the free world in these next 4 years which will keep the peace without surrender and which will extend the freedom throughout the world .	Our problems are serious - and they have been with us for a long time .

The Republican leadership of the Senate knows full well that under the parliamentary situation of these final crowded weeks - and in the political atmosphere of rancor that developed - no significant civil rights measure could have passed .

We are , therefore , now in a position to further this mounting scientific attack upon disease and health problems by broad general programs directed toward the support of research , training of medical , dental , and other health manpower , and expansion of health care facilities . This will not be simple or easy .	Kennedy_October_3_1960	Nixon_October_2_1960
0189	cuba	attack	But in the case of both Africa and Latin America , the hour is late , the world is moving fast , our role and our position have changed , and I do think it is vitally important in those areas and in other areas that we precede events ; that we do not move after them . In other words , I do not like to see the United States offer assistance to Latin America as a result of difficulties in Cuba . I would like to see us offer the hand of friendship to Latin America because of a traditional conviction that the United States can not maintain its freedom unless Latin America is a strong and viable and growing hemisphere .	Talk about the situation , for example , in Cuba . Does Mr. Khrushchev gain prestige because he shoots down hundreds of thousands of people in the streets of Budapest in Hungary ? And does President Eisenhower lose prestige for America because he does not use our great power as he could against Mr. Castro in Cuba and the Cuban people ? But he works with other American States in developing the opinions which will keep the Cuban people on our side when eventually they get the right to choose the kind of government they want to . No; we gain ; they do n't .	Kennedy_September_23_1960	Nixon_September_21_1960

To assure a vital economy , he promises a minimum wage that official studies show would force unemployment and business failures . To protect the unfortunate , he promises to give the wealthiest people in American a helping hand with medical costs in their later years , while withholding help from some 3 million people with incomes of $ 2,000 or less ; in fact , in the name of freedom he would force this medical program on one and all , save the 3 million who need help the most .	I am chairman of the Subcommitee on Labor . We tried to put through a minimum wage of $ 1.25 an hour .

0191	minimum wage	attack	It amounts , for a family of four people , to $ 6.50 for a family of four , which amounts to a grand total of 5 cents per person per day , in the richest country on earth . If you feel that a minimum wage of $ 1.25 is extreme , if you believe that medical care for the aged tied to social security is worse than a medical aid bill which requires that an old person must take an oath that he is medically indigent , a pauper 's oath , before he gets public assistance , if you feel it is proper to veto two depressed area bills , if you are pleased by the fact that we built this year in September 30 percent less homes than a year ago , and that this administration has vetoed two housing bills in the last 12 months , if you think that is good , Mr. Nixon is your man . [ Response from the audience .	The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve . In 1960 , this administration sought to extend minimum wage coverage to 3.1 million additional workers and indicated support of an increase in the minimum wage to $ 1.15 per hour .

0192	medical care,health care	no_relation	Some of you may raise a question here when I say this is the most important issue , but I am sure when you consider it you will agree with me . Other issues are important - whether or not we have a good job , the kind of social security that we have for our old age , the kind of medical care that we get , the development of the right kind of school system and all the other things in which all Americans are interested , but you know , we can have the best social security , the best housing , the best jobs that we could possibly imagine , and it is n't going to make any difference if we 're not around to enjoy them . So , this is the issue of our time .	If we appropriate $ 600 million for defense , the President can impound it . If we pass legislation dealing with the minimum wage or medical care for the aged tied to social security , if the President vetoes that bill , his veto can be sustained by one-third of the Senate plus one and / or one-third of the House plus one . Therefore , in order for the Congress , which is today Democratic , to fulfill its commitments as supporters of the Democratic platform it is also necessary to have a President that can work with the Congress and not against it .

Under the bill which the Congress passed , anybody before 65 who needs medical care who has $ 800 or $ 1,000 saved up must first spend that money , exhaust their savings , take an oath that they are needy , and then they will get some assistance . I believe the other way , and that is the way the Democratic Party favors it .	Whenever there is any job to be done they say ,  We 've got to go to Washington and then work down to the people .  We say the answer to progress in America is not to turn to Washington every time you have a problem first , but to start with the people first and work up to Washington , D.C. We say the way to get the jobs and the housing and the medical care and the schools , all the progress that America wants , is to stimulate the creative energies of 180 million free Americans . We say the way to progress is not to weaken the States , but to strengthen the States and the local governments .	Kennedy_September_28_1960	Nixon_September_27_1960

I really meant what the President said - we want to give moral support to the cause of freedom .	He was wrong .

I know what it is in the little store in which I worked to see a child of an unemployed man come in and have to ask to put things on the bill , knowing that his dad or hers probably was n't going to get a job for a while .

So , this is the way to peace , and I want you to know that we will have no greater obligation than to keep the peace for ourselves , for our children , and also to see to it that our children have an opportunity to grow up and have a better life even than we 've had .	We have gone into every conference unprepared . This administration , a year ago , in order to get a position on disarmament , appointed a lawyer from my own State of Massachusetts , Mr. Coolidge , who had had no previous experience in the field . After 3 months , his report was dismissed and so was he , and a New York lawyer , after 5 weeks of preparation , was sent to head up our mission to the Disarmament Conference .

0197	cuba	no_relation	We must be strong in purpose , we must be strong in leadership , we must be strong militarily , and we must be strong economically . It is no accident that the Communists have made their greatest gains from Laos to Cuba to Africa , during the period when our relative strength was in decline , when 1 out of every 16 Americans is unemployed , when 1 out of 20 who is employed is forced to work part time , when great industries like steel are barely working half of their capacity , when , for 7 years , our farmers have been caught in a cruel squeeze between ever-increasing rises in their costs and a decline in their prices , which has caused them to be the most oppressed group in the American economy , when mining is depressed , when lumber production is double and transportation is down , and the cost of living goes up . Mr. Khrushchev confronts us at the United Nations with arrogant confidence , because he believes that the economy of the Soviet Union and the Communist bloc is growing at a faster relative rate than is ours .	There is resentment against the so-called colossus of the north , resentment which we could understand if we were in the same position , I am sure . Now , as far as our program toward Cuba is concerned though I would say that , from what I have learned , from talking to some Latin American leaders and from the reports I have read from our diplomats who have talked to Latin American leaders in other countries , they applaud what the United States has been doing toward Castro , by the strength that we have shown , the fact that we have not thrown our weight around in a way that many would have thought would have been unreasonable . They feel we were correct , I think , the majority of them , in acting as we did with regard to the sugar , the taking away of special consideration that we had with regard to sugar .

The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve .	Mr. Nixon said that on the debate a week ago . That is the same party that voted 90 percent against 25 cents minimum wage . I do n't lead a party which voted 90 percent against social security , which ran a presidential candidate , Alf Landon , in 1936 , calling for the repeal of social security , and yet that is the same party in 1960 that voted against medical care for the aged .

It shows you how we approach these problems , retaining individual enterprise , building on it , rather than supplementing it completely by Federal Government activities . Now , if I might turn to another subject , the last one , the most important of all , what could be more important than medical care , I am sure some of you may ask , or jobs , schools , the 4-day week in schools ? What could be more important that all these things ? Well , you know . The ability to be able to be around to enjoy them - and I say , as I said last night and as I will say throughout this campaign , that the most important issue in this campaign is this : Which of the two candidates for the Presidency is best qualified , by experience , by judgment , by background , to keep the peace , but keep the peace without surrender of principle or territory for the United States and the world ? This is the great issue .	Kennedy_October_15_1960	Nixon_October_14_1960

You have the Kennedy bill , which would raise the minimum wage on a graduated basis to a dollar and a quarter in 3 years , and which would expand coverage to 5 million people not presently covered . You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase . It takes coverage away from some .	Kennedy_September_3_1960	Nixon_August_13_1960

But this program alone will not be enough without a change in attitude - unless we realize that unemployment , poverty , slums , hunger , and rundown schools are all man made , and they can be eliminated by man . It has been that attitude which has made this country great and we will restore it to the conduct of Government in 1961 .	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .

These figures tell a human story - the story of unemployment benefits running out - of 3 million Americans forced to live on an unhealthy tasteless diet of surplus foods - a story of hardship and personal tragedy . What , then , does Mr. Nixon mean when he says we are enjoying the greatest prosperity that Americans have ever enjoyed ? Perhaps he believes that if only 1 out of every 10 Americans are unable to find full-time work , the other 9 out of every 10 must be doing all right .	I know what it is in the little store in which I worked to see a child of an unemployed man come in and have to ask to put things on the bill , knowing that his dad or hers probably was n't going to get a job for a while .

0206	disarmament	no_relation	I want to explain that in terms of examples today because it seems to me there has been a great lack of understanding in recent months , and , for that matter in recent years , as to why the United States has followed the line that it has diplomatically . People have often spoken to me and they have said ,  Why ca n't we be more flexible in our dealings on disarmament ? Why ca n't we find a bold new program in this area which will make it possible for the Soviet Union to agree ?  And the answer is , of course , that the United States has gone the extra mile in disarmament time and time again . The answer is that the reason the Soviet Union has not agreed is that they do not want apparently to disarm unless we give up the right to inspection .	It occupied them from the first day they went into politics until in the case of Webster he died 40 years later . Now the problems swarm across the desk of the political leaders of this country : monetary and fiscal policy , the control of outer space , disarmament , nuclear cessations , control of agricultural surpluses , control of business cycles , automation , stimulation of our economy , the extension of the franchise to our citizens , the extension of our influence around the world , the struggle for a better world , the struggle for a stronger America , and unless there is the most intimate association between those who look to the far horizons and those who deal with our daily problems , then quite obviously we shall not pass through these stormy times with success , so I am delighted to come here today . I think it is appropriate we bring this campaign here .	Nixon_October_18_1960	Kennedy_October_17_1960

I have never advocated and I do not now advocate intervention in Cuba in violation of our treaty obligations and in fact stated in Johnstown , Pa . , that whatever we did with regard to Cuba should be within the confines of international law .

This fast-moving technological revolution offers hope of vastly increased productivity - of greater abundance for all Americans .

The whole problem in Cuba is what is going to happen in the rest of Latin America , whose side is going to be successful in those areas , which system offers the hope to these people . Bolivia , where the average annual income is about $ 100 a person - are they going to be more impressed by Castro and what he says , or are they going to be impressed by us ? Franklin Roosevelt impressed them not so much because he poured out American money , but because he was a moving , compassionate figure , moving his own society at home , identifying himself with people around the world who also wish to live in the sun .

[ Response from the audience .	Promises for what ? Promises that would go back . Promises that would restore in this country policies that reduced the value of our dollars ; promises that would bring back in this country policies which discouraged business investment , policies which resulted in unemployment , policies which stagnated the American economy . I just want to say in that connection that , as you consider the promises that have been made in this campaign , we all must remember that we pay for them , and as far as my opponent is concerned all that he offers is - what ? He offers promises ; promises that would add $ 15 billion a year to our Federal spending in Washington .	Kennedy_November_2_1960	Nixon_November_1_1960

I have confidence in this Nation 's ability to look out for its older citizens , to see that they have a decent pension and a decent home and decent medical care . The people who oppose this program for medical care under social security are the very same people who fought President Roosevelt in 1935 , the very same people who supported Alf Landon in his campaign in 1936 , running on the single platform of repealing social security .	[ Cheers . ] But you k now what could be more important than our job ? What could be more important than our education for our young people ? What could be more important than health care for our older citizens and for ourselves ? And the answer is being around to enjoy all these good things . So I say to you today that the most important decision you will make on November 8 is this : Which of the candidates for the Presidency , for the Vice Presidency , can best furnish the leadership that will keep the peace for America without surrender and extend freedom throughout the world ?

I am determined to undertake every sensible measure to that end , to lift to ever higher levels the number of jobs in America , to reduce unemployment further , and to utilize more fully our industrial capacity in steel and other lines To achieve that goal we must release fully the greatest creative force in human affairs - the spirit of individual enterprise in 180 million Americans . That effort calls for a many-sided program which I have been developing , and will continue to develop , in this campaign .	Getting down to specific problems of concern to business , Senator Kennedy feels that the most effective antidote for inflation is increased productivity and greater production . He advocates a balanced budget , except during times of emergency affecting the national security , or high rate of unemployment . Collective bargaining must take public as well as private interest into account .	Nixon_October_19_1960	Kennedy_October_10_1960
0215	disarmament	attack	Our negotiators had to leave Geneva for Washington during the conference itself to try to find out what our policy was . Again , we had failed to prepare for disarmament . We had developed no real policy or position .	We have to have the power because we are friends of peace . As long as America is the strongest nation in the world , the world need not fear that there will be war , because we will use our strength to keep peace , and I think that all of you , including those who are as dedicated to peace as I am , will say that we want the next President of the United States always to go the extra mile , as President Eisenhower has , to negotiate with Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else for disarmament . We want to go the extra mile to strengthen the United Nations and the instruments of peace , but under no circumstances do we want the next President to be a man who will be fooled , who will make concessions to them without getting concessions in return , and , above all , we do not want the next President to be one who will reduce the strength of America unless we 're absolutely sure that the enemies of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time .

Now , the question is : What can we do about it ? My opponent says when he was here ,  Oh , Mr. Nixon is against helping the older people who need medical care .  Now , that is just a complete falsehood .	This is the only method of meeting that test . Opponents of medical care have pretended that it would lead to socialized medicine . Let me make it perfectly clear that I have always opposed socialized medicine and that what the Republicans really oppose is adequate medical care .	Nixon_October_24_1960	Kennedy_October_24_1960
0222	medical care,health care	no_relation	We want a Government in which , as I noted one of the signs here , we can have our taxes within reason and our prices not skyrocketing . We want a Government in which we can have good medical care , and better schools , better housing . All of these things Americans want .	We have 16 million Americans over the age of 65 who live on an average social security check of less than $ 78 a month . How are they going to get by and find homes , shelter , and medical care ? These are the problems that the United States must face . I am delighted to discuss any problems that anyone wants to raise in this campaign , but I want to turn Mr. Nixon 's attention not only to the coast of China but to the United States and New Jersey and the problems it faces and our people face .	Nixon_October_17_1960	Kennedy_October_16_1960
0223	medical care,health care	no_relation	It is inconceivable to me that anyone could oppose these measures . How can a nation as rich as ours tolerate substandard wages ? How can we justify the absence of a decent program of health care for our older citizens ? Why must so many of our children attend crowded and inadequate schools , and live in squalid homes ? Why must we continue to have unfair and arbitrary restrictions on labor 's right to use its economic power in support of its legitimate collective bargaining objectives ? But , we have just begun to fight . If the American people give us their support at the polls in November , and elect a Democratic administration and a liberal Congress , we will be able to give this country the legislation and the leadership which it so badly needs .	Now , people disagree with that . Senator Kennedy and Senator Johnson believe that the social security route , which would compel all people - whether they wanted health insurance or not - to , in effect , have it through subscribing to social security , is the best one to provide medical care or people over 65 . I believe that the most effective method is through a program which will provide a choice whereby people who want to have the protection for catastrophic illnesses or , for that matter , for noncatastrophic illnesses , if they so desire , can have it , but where they are not forced to have it if they do not desire , and where they can choose getting that protection through government or through private plans , which they might choose , with some government assistance .

The appointment of the Medical Advisory Committee today follows Senator Kennedy 's announcement last week of a 23-member Board of Senior Citizens for Kennedy , all of whom are prominent in the field of health , to assist the Democratic Presidential candidate in emphasizing the importance of medical care for senior citizens .

As President Eisenhower has indicated time and time again , the United States can not tolerate Russian influence or a Russian-dominated government in Cuba or in the Americas . Now the President has made that clear .	For America can not afford to continue to waste her resources and the skills of her people . The implacable Communist drive toward world domination now reaches to within 90 miles of our shores - on the once - friendly island of Cuba - and communism is on the march in Asia , and Africa and the Near East .

Yes , there are problems , problems like the one in Cuba that my opponent is discussing tonight without offering any solution for , and , incidentally , may I say , looking at that problem , I will have more to say about that at a later time , and he had better look to the record of his administration before he starts criticizing ours in that field . He talks about dictators , and I can only say that the number of dictators we inherited from the Truman administration is far greater than the number we have today in Latin America , and that 's something he must remember .	That was more scholarships than we had offered the 2 preceding years to all of Africa . When we broke off the sugar quota from Cuba last June , we offered economic aid to Latin America . Mr. Nixon , on  Meet the Press  a month ago , said that if we had developed that program 5 years ago , perhaps we could have prevented Castro from seizing power in Cuba .

0230	unemployment	no_relation	But northern Minnesota has not been the only area to suffer . This Nation today has more than 126 areas of substantial unemployment - almost 4 million Americans out of work - and 1 out of every 10 Americans struggle to support themselves and their families without any job , or with only part-time work . If your mining areas are depressed - it is because mining areas all over the Nation are depressed - and our vital steel industry is being allowed to operate at barely 50 percent of capacity .	I will tell you today the things that I believe are necessary , the program that I stand for . I will tell you , for example , that I think we need economic policies that will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million people , that will increase employment , that we need Government policies , for example , which will provide better guarantees and better protection against unemployment than we presently have . I will tell you today , for example , that I think those policies will produce more economic programs and progress than will the policies of our opponents .

0231	medical care,health care	attack	We provide , under the program that we are offering and have worked for in the Congress , medical care for the aged tied to social security . Mr. Nixon leads a party in this campaign that voted 90 percent in the mid-thirties against social security itself ; and in the month of August 1960 , voted 95 percent against medical care for the aged tied to social security . I believe in an America where every family can live in a decent home in a decent neighborhood ; where children can play safely ; where no home is unsafe or unsanitary , and today there are 15 million American homes which are substandard , and yet , even though our population is increasing , we 're building this year 30 percent less homes in the month of September than we did a year ago - partly , because this administration in the last 15 months has vetoed two housing bills - and we were unable to pass one in this session of the Congress .	No nation has made greater progress in meeting the human needs of all its citizens than has the United States in the past 25 years . Our standards of health care , of welfare services , and of economic security are equal to or higher than those of any other nation - anywhere , anytime . In this development , we have consistently followed two traditional principles : the first , arising out of the heart of the Judaeo - Christian heritage , is that each of us is morally responsible for the welfare of his fellow men .

0232	minimum wage	no_relation	They talked . But what did they produce ? They promised a 25-percent minimum wage increase in place of the program that President Eisenhower asked for and that could have been passed and should have been passed . What did the workers get ? Nothing at all .	It is not only medical care for the aged . It is minimum wage , it is housing for the elderly , public housing . It is all under social security .

0234	minimum wage	support	[ Applause . ] When the vote comes in the House and Senate , as Adam Powell knows and Senator Lehman knows , who provides the majority of the votes on every issue , on civil rights , on housing , and minimum wage , sickness , health , good days and bad , who provides the majority of the votes , who offers the amendments , who tries to get them through ? A majority of the Democrats . And the record shows that the majority of those who oppose are Republicans and on all the issues .	And , so I want to make clear where we do stand . I favor programs , programs that are constructive , programs that will work , programs that will produce progress ; more schools , a breakthrough in science , a breakthrough in medical care and medical research , progress in terms of better jobs for the American people , raising the minimum standards as far as our minimum wage , and our unemployment coverage is concerned . All of these things I stand for , but I want to make one thing clear : As far as the cost of my programs are concerned , they are billions less than what my opponent 's would cost .

0235	minimum wage	attack	In the midthirties , 90 percent of the Republican Party voted against a 25-cent minimum wage . This summer , as your Congressman can tell you , in the House of Representatives , 90 percent of the Republicans voted against a minimum wage of $ 1.25 an hour , $ 50 a week for a 40-hour week , for a business that makes more than a million dollars a year , and Mr. Nixon called it extreme . He is frozen in the ice of his own indifference if I ever saw a Republican candidate who was .	The misstatement : In the second debate Senator Kennedy said : The Republicans in recent years , not only in the last 25 years , but in the last 8 years , have opposed * * * minimum wage * * The facts : Senator Kennedy is saying that Republicans who opposed his particular bill are against minimum wage . The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve . In 1960 , this administration sought to extend minimum wage coverage to 3.1 million additional workers and indicated support of an increase in the minimum wage to $ 1.15 per hour .

0236	cuba	attack	So , here are two instances . And then we have the instance of Cuba , an instance again where the intentions were good , but where , because of lack of knowledge , apparently , or understanding , he made a suggestion which has rocked the capitals of the world . It has dismayed our friends .	The Associated Press this month featured an excellent survey by Relman Morin entitled  U.S. Prestige Is Damaged in Asia  - citing our image in that continent as that of a  well-meaning but confused and confusing giant .  To the Asian , this report said , the administration 's policy on Cuba  was a clear case of American indecision , fumbling , and possible weakness .  The events of last summer , the survey reported - the U-2 , summit , and Toyko chain of events -  appear to have shown that the United States was weak , indecisive , incapable of evaluating trends , anticipating developments and formulating action to meet them .

0237	unemployment	no_relation	Consider their whole 20-year record . For 6 years in the 1930 's the opposition failed miserably to solve the problem of unemployment . In 1939 , when war came in Europe , unemployment in America , after 6 futile years of their trying to solve it , stood just under 9 ½ million .	Fourth , we will extend and apply practical programs to ease the lot of persons caught up in the steel crisis . Those forced to rely on unemployment insurance should receive more adequate benefits for a more adequate period . Those forced to rely on surplus food packages should receive a more balanced , nourishing diet .	Nixon_October_19_1960	Kennedy_October_9_1960
0238	cuba	no_relation	The question can be stated this way :  What should the U.S. Government do about Castro ?  I favor an economic and political quarantine as outlined in my American Legion speech . Specifically you state that  We must attempt to strengthen the non-Batista democratic anti-Castro forces in exile , and in Cuba itself who offer eventual hope of overthrowing Castro . Thus far these fighters for freedom have had virtually no support from our Government .	Equally important are the domestic issues which you and the Republican Party seem to wish to bury during this campaign - minimum wage , medical care for the aged , aid to education , and the rising rate of unemployment ; only a week ago you stated you were going to talk about Quemoy and Matsu every day for the final 3 weeks of the campaign . Now it is Cuba . These latter two are important issues but I think the American people want and deserve to hear us discuss all the important problems which face our country and to limit the subject of the fifth to one country would be to subvert the purpose of such a debate .

0239	medical care,health care	attack	 But in the next breath he tells us that we ca n't afford to do those things in America that everybody knows we need to do . He says we ca n't afford to do what this great country should be doing in education , in programs for the aging , in medical care , in housing , in development of our natural resources . I say we can .	Government has tremendous responsibilities , and you , of course , know that whoever is President of this country is going to make decisions that will affect not only the Federal budget , but the family budget , that will affect also the basic issue of all time , and that is whether we 're going to have peace , and have it without surrender , in the years ahead . Now , in talking to those points , I want to first say that certainly there is no issue that is more important than the one that I mentioned last , because we can have the best jobs and the best education ; we can have the best medical care that we can possibly imagine , and it is n't going to make any difference if we are not around to enjoy it . Now , I simply think it 's time for us to lay it on the line with regard to what the record is insofar as keeping the peace is concerned , because sometimes our memories are pretty short .

That it be tied to social security , that everyone contribute 3 cents a day , and they be given out of a fund to which they contributed medical care when they retired . [ Applause .	We will take over the problems in the field of education . We will take them over in the field of medical care at the Federal level . We will do all these things , and you do n't have to worry .

0241	disarmament	attack	So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war . That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests . Yes , but we will never agree to an agreement unless the Soviet Union is going to require inspection as well as the United States .	But no matter how difficult the problems are , how discouraging the obstacles , how uncertain the prospect for agreement , we must , nevertheless , begin a determined , large-scale effort to prepare ourselves for disarmament - to formulate constructive and realistic proposals which have a chance of success . For the hopes of all mankind rest on successful disarmament . And if we let the nations of Africa and Asia and Latin America feel that the United States is the real obstacle to disarmament , that we are not sincere in our desire for peace - if we continue to let the Soviet Union seize the offensive in disarmament negotiations - then these emerging areas of the world may well turn away from America and the free world , and begin to look to the Communist bloc for leadership in the fight for peace .

0242	medical care,health care	no_relation	Who are the people that are hit ? No.1, those who are retired , those who live on an average of $ 72 a month under social security . When we put forward a proposal this summer to provide medical care for the aged tied to social security , we had one Republican vote in the Senate , and when the vote was announced Time magazine said Mr. Nixon turned and smiled . He will not be smiling on November 8. [ Applause .	We just want to keep it as it is . We do n't care about medical care for the aged . He says , as far as we are concerned , we have no programs , nothing to offer , except standing where we are .	Kennedy_October_27_1960	Nixon_October_26_1960
0243	medical care,health care	no_relation	Let me speak now of a more important issue . I am sure when you heard the words  more important  some of you thought :  What could be more important than education for our children , a better job , adequate hospitals and health care , all these things that I have mentioned ?  The answer is :  We can have the best social security system , the best education , the best jobs that we can imagine , and it is not going to do any good unless we are around to enjoy them .  So I urge all of you , without regard to your partisan affiliations , to have this major issue in mind as you go to the polls on election day :  Which of the two candidates , which of the two tickets , do you believe best provides the kind of leadership that will keep the peace for America and keep it without a surrender of principle ?  Here we think we have a good record .	They are : ( 1 ) Hospitalization up to 120 days ; ( 2 ) Nursing home care up to 240 days ; ( 3 ) Nursing and other health services at home up to 360 days ; ( 4 ) Outpatient diagnostic services . Such a program will be soundly financed ; it will provide a balanced program of basic health services ; it will relieve the burden upon our hospitals by providing incentives for nonhospital care ; it emphasizes preventive medical care ; and it tends to reduce the overall cost of the program by using less expensive yet more effective medical techniques . Enactment of this legislation during the present session will be a fitting climax to this 25th anniversary of the Social Security Act and mark a historic step forward in sustaining the dignity and self-reliance of our Nation 's senior citizens .

0245	cuba	no_relation	For under Republican leadership our prestige has fallen so low that our Latin American allies are no longer willing to follow our leadership in the fight against communism in this hemisphere . Second , we must consider more stringent economic sanctions - such as the seizing of all Cuban assets in this country to be used to pay off some of the vast sums which Cuba still owes us . Of course Cuban assets in this country - which were an estimated $ 200 million in June - have declined drastically in the last months as the Republicans have let this potential opportunity slip away .	I believe this matter is so fundamental to decency in world affairs that until Red China has proved her adherence to these standards by her deeds and not just by her words , the next President should consider a veto , which we have never used , to be fully justified by the United States in the National Security Council - a veto of any effort to admit a nation that does not comply , as Red China does not comply . And now I want to turn to one other subject at hand , much closer , the problem of Cuba , a very difficult problem . People have often said ,  Mr .	Kennedy_October_20_1960	Nixon_October_18_1960
0246	unemployment	attack	In fact , unemployment is only insignificant to Mr. Nixon and a Republican Party which has opposed every Democratic effort to put men back to work in the past 8 years - which has complacently stood by while unemployment rose from less than 2 million in 1952 to 4 million today and while Michigan lost more than 100,000 jobs despite an expanding population . For I believe that the American people are going to reject a party which - again in Mr. Nixon 's words - believes that  unemployment is inevitable ,  a party which lacks faith in the capacity of a strong and growing America to provide jobs for all its people , a party which , in the most fundamental sense , is letting America run down because it is failing to build America up , a party whose candidate is all too ready to threaten war but is unwilling to build up the strength which is the only guarantee of peace , who is always willing to speak loudly , but is unwilling to be sure that America carries a big stick . The Republican slowdown of the American economy is reflected in the record of the past 30 years .	Have you ever talked to a Negro mother as I have ? Have you ever heard her tell you , try to explain to a child in the South ? How do you explain that she can go into a store and buy a loaf of bread but ca n't sit at the counter and have a Coca - Cola ? This makes you understand that it is n't enough just to pass laws ; it is n't enough just to make speeches , but what you have to do is do what the Attorney General of the United States must do , not just a lot of promises and talk , but get in the leaders of chainstores and get them to agree to break down this barrier so that we can remove this block from the people of this country and our Nation . What about unemployment ? How can you believe me when I say I will move this economy forward , that we will use all the power of this Government to fight unemployment , to fight recession ; but , more than that , we 're going to use it in a positive way to stimulate employment , to open new avenues for expansion of economy ? How do you know ? How can you believe me ? I 'll tell you why . Because I know what it means .	Kennedy_October_14_1960	Nixon_October_5_1960
0248	unemployment	no_relation	But we can always do better and I am determined that we shall do better in quickening the pace of our economic advance and in minimizing interruptions to it . I am determined to undertake every sensible measure to that end , to lift to ever higher levels the number of jobs in America , to reduce unemployment further , and to utilize more fully our industrial capacity in steel and other lines To achieve that goal we must release fully the greatest creative force in human affairs - the spirit of individual enterprise in 180 million Americans . That effort calls for a many-sided program which I have been developing , and will continue to develop , in this campaign .	[ Applause . ] These problems of housing and social security , unemployment compensation , minimum wages , and the others fall into the general category of proposals put forward either in the administration of President Wilson or President Roosevelt , or President Truman . In that field , though in some ways it is a new problem , but an old one , I would include education because this country has been aiding education since the country began , since the Northwest Ordinance set aside one-sixteenth of the territory in order to help education , back when this country was founded , to the land grant colleges in 1862 , to the vocational aids , to the aids to impacted districts .

0249	medical care,health care	attack	Those forced to rely on surplus food packages should receive a more balanced , nourishing diet . And to meet the pressing problem confronting men past working age , and their families , we must put through an effective program of medical care for the aged under the social security system . The present medical care program will not send one penny to needy persons without further action by the Congress and the State legislatures .	It will meet it honestly . It will do a better job , and I resent the attacks of our opponents when they say we are against health care for the aged and they 're for it because , as I will tell you , we are for the only program that will do the job , and theirs wo n't do the job , and it 's time that they be called on it . Look at the problem , and this is an indication of how we approach these problems .	Kennedy_October_9_1960	Nixon_October_6_1960
0250	cuba	no_relation	And this would not have happened in Cuba if the Republican leadership Mr. Nixon represents every step which foresight and experience should have directed them to take - in order to prevent a Communist victory only 90 miles from our shores . I do not know how Mr. Nixon can talk of firmness in view of his party 's record in Cuba . I do not know how he can talk of experience in view of his party 's experience in Cuba .	These are the times that you can read and have the time to read that you will never have later , and you can get the opportunity to specialize much later . You can learn about political science by participating in political organizations , and I would say certainly a political science course under the very able people who instruct you in our colleges and universities is worth while , but particularly to those who want to enter public service , if I could leave just one note - Remember , that while the broad background in the humanities and history and literature would seem to be very remote from the problems of Ghana and Cuba , from the problems of what we do about health care and what we do about the filibuster , remember those are the courses that will give you the judgment and the depth that is needed to react properly and intelligently to these great issues when they come before you years later , if you happen to enter public life . The last point that I would make is this : I want everybody here to certainly feel the necessity for , as I put it , going into politics ; I do n't mean all of you should run for office .	Kennedy_October_15_1960	Nixon_October_14_1960
0251	medical care,health care	no_relation	I think that in many ways the issues are clearer here than they may be in any other part of the United States . I say that because in a very real sense the State of California in the last decade has experienced the same problems which the United States will experience over a period of 50 years , tremendous growth , tremendous economic change , development of your natural resources , the effect of a war economy and a peace economy on this State , the necessity of building new schools , of educating our children here in California , the necessity of meeting the needs of our older citizens , particularly in the field of medical care . I think in a very real sense California has had the problems of the country forced upon them in a concentrated period of time .	I believe that the most effective method is through a program which will provide a choice whereby people who want to have the protection for catastrophic illnesses or , for that matter , for noncatastrophic illnesses , if they so desire , can have it , but where they are not forced to have it if they do not desire , and where they can choose getting that protection through government or through private plans , which they might choose , with some government assistance . And I would agree with Senator Kennedy , incidentally , to this extent : he indicated that this would be an issue in the campaign , I think it will be an issue in the campaign , and the question will not be one of ends , because both of us believe that there should he protection for our older citizens for medical care . The question will be one of means .	Kennedy_September_11_1960	Nixon_August_24_1960
0252	minimum wage	attack	[ Applause . ] I do not believe that a political party which in the last 25 years has opposed housing and , minimum wage and social security and every great domestic program which has been identified with progress in this country , which has refused to recognize our changing times around the world , which liquidated the credit which Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman built up in Latin America , which has shown itself wholly uninformed of the present revolution now taking place in Africa , which has failed to maintain our military strength , which has given almost no attention to the important subject of disarmament , having less than 100 people working on it in the entire Federal Government , which has permitted us to be second , best in outer space , which has brought less foreign students to study here today than 10 years ago , which has , in other words , presided over the United States in a changing time and refused to change - I believe on November 8 the people of this country are going to take progress for the future , are going to give the leadership of this country once more to the Democrats . [ Applause .	Meanwhile , the contradictory statements of Senator Kennedy still leave him opposed to this position .

0253	medical care,health care	no_relation	This addition to inflationary government seems to be the one thing the Senator and Mr. Truman have in common . This fact makes the Senator a vocal champion of such programs as medical care for the aged , but in actual fact their enemy . No matter what Mr. Kennedy says , the program for our senior citizens that I stand for will be adopted by the Congress .	And finally , in 1959 , we passed a bill to provide housing for the elderly , and the administration vetoed it . Lastly , in 1960 , and this is the end of a sad , sad story , when Senator Anderson and I introduced an amendment to provide medical care for the aged tied to social security , do you know how many Republican votes we got ? One ; 44 Democrats and 1 Republican . And do you know when the vote was announced , a great national magazine said ,  Mr .	Nixon_November_3_1960	Kennedy_November_3_1960

I would just add this last point : I do not agree with those people who say that what we should do when we have problems is just to leave them to the States and to the individuals . Now , if the States and the individuals will handle the problems of schools , if they will provide the medical care , if they will do the things that the people want done and that should be done , that is certainly the proper thing to do . But it is the responsibility of the Federal Government to step in where individual or local government can not or will not do the job .	Kennedy_October_9_1960	Nixon_October_8_1960

And also my opponent knows this : He knows the unemployment figure dropped last month and , you know , a funny thing , that same Detroit paper that carried that story had another eight column headline right below it . You know what it said ?  Car Sales at Alltime High .	This administration has stood still and so has Richard Nixon for 14 years that I have been in the Congress with him . On all the great issues which disturb our country , minimum wage , social security , unemployment compensation , houses , roads , schools , hospitals , our parties have divided and we have divided , and the great questions for the 1960 's are how is it going to be possible to move this country forward , build its economy , provide employment for its people .

He was defeated .	Some of you may raise a question here when I say this is the most important issue , but I am sure when you consider it you will agree with me . Other issues are important - whether or not we have a good job , the kind of social security that we have for our old age , the kind of medical care that we get , the development of the right kind of school system and all the other things in which all Americans are interested , but you know , we can have the best social security , the best housing , the best jobs that we could possibly imagine , and it is n't going to make any difference if we 're not around to enjoy them .

The whole problem in Cuba is what is going to happen in the rest of Latin America , whose side is going to be successful in those areas , which system offers the hope to these people . Bolivia , where the average annual income is about $ 100 a person - are they going to be more impressed by Castro and what he says , or are they going to be impressed by us ? Franklin Roosevelt impressed them not so much because he poured out American money , but because he was a moving , compassionate figure , moving his own society at home , identifying himself with people around the world who also wish to live in the sun .	Too often in these discussions of foreign affairs we become obsessed with the problems of the moment . It 's Cuba or Quemoy and Matsu . It 's military power and missiles .

With regard to your telegram of today I am glad you have finally accepted my challenge to participate in this debate .	And on the other side there is the wrong and demagogic way - the right that I have pointed out , the wrong which Senator Kennedy has advocated - and I say this is a way of shooting from the hip on matters gravely affecting the security of the United States . And , so , finally , let 's look at the record , all three , the position on Quemoy and Matsu - slice off a bit of freedom ; maybe it will lead to peace ; the position on the summit conference - express regrets to Khrushchev ; maybe we can save the conference , and then this latest episode with regard to Cuba . I think when you look at these three episodes that this should convince many Americans that they could not rest well at night with a man with such a total lack of judgment as Commander in Chief of our Armed Forces in this critical period .

Well , if we are all for the same goals , why did the Republicans defeat our efforts to provide a minimum wage of $ 1.25 , and medical care for our aged citizens , and Federal aid to education , and housing to rebuild our cities ? Our goals are not the same , nor are the means the same , nor have they been since Theodore Roosevelt . A Democratic Party sees the government and the people working together for a stronger and better country , for , in Paul Douglas ' words , a juster America .	Physicians and scientists in fields closely allied to medicine have told me how they are already probing below the level of the body 's cells and have begun to explore the molecules in the cells - the fundamental area where both normality and disease are controlled . We are , therefore , now in a position to further this mounting scientific attack upon disease and health problems by broad general programs directed toward the support of research , training of medical , dental , and other health manpower , and expansion of health care facilities .

The time and patience which we have already expended to explore this way out of the disarmament dilemma have been full proof of our own intentions and those of the Soviets . The blame rests squarely on them .	Fifth - And most important , the fight for disarmament must command the personal attention and concern of the President of the United States . Our defense and six disarmament experts are concentrated in many important agencies of Government - in the State Department , the Defense Department , the AEC and others . Only the President can overcome the frictions and differences between those agencies ; only he can weld all the parts of the Executive into a singleness of purpose in the pursuit of peace , and only the President can make the hard decisions , decisions involving peace or war , destruction or survival , which peace programs as well as war programs will surely bring .

It would , as we have seen from the immediate response of shock and dismay in Latin America , alienate every one of our sister American Republics whose friendship you have acknowledged is of vital importance to our efforts against communism . 3. It would give Mr. Khrushchev a valid excuse to intervene in Cuba on the side of the Castro government , saying that the United States had intervened in violation of its treaty obligations in trying to overthrow the existing government . 4. If this happened , your policy could lead to World War III .	I think the great opportunity was really denied in 1957 , during the last days of the Batista administration . I was in Cuba in 1957 and the American Ambassador informed me that the American Ambassador was the second most influential man in Cuba . There is not any doubt we had great influence in Cuba , and I think it is unfortunate that we did not use that influence more vigorously to persuade Mr. Batista to hold free , open elections , so that the people of Cuba could have made the choice , rather than holding onto his power and finally driven out by Castro at the point of a gun .

We also want better schools because certainly we think of our children and as good as our opportunities have been , we want theirs to be better . We want better hospitals , better medical care .

0266	cuba	attack	Actually , the United States has given more assistance to Yugoslavia since the end of World War II than it has to all of Latin America combined . It is an unfortunate fact that the assistance which was proposed at the time of the Bogota Conference really represented assistance which the United States was determined to give Latin America only when our relations with Cuba soured to the point where we broke off the sugar quota . I think it would have been far wiser for the United States to have held out the hand of friendship 6 , 7 , or 8 years , to help to provide a long-term loan [ applause ] to help provide specifically long-term loans for their capital improvements .	I realize that line is subject to criticism , because we have a very difficult situation ; but to those who do criticize what we are doing my answer , of course , is : What is the alternative ? There are those who say ,  Why do n't we send Marines to Cuba ?  We could do it and we could give it to Mr. Castro in 24 hours , but getting rid of Castro in Cuba would not get rid of Castroism in Cuba or in Latin America and it would set in motion , in my opinion , a chain reaction of opposition to the United States through the other Latin American countries , which could be very , very detrimental to our foreign policy . That 's why I think the United States , with its great power , has to continue to treat Cuba , as it has , with consideration , always patient , working with our other friends in Latin America , to be sure that they will support our position toward Castro and toward his close association with communism in Cuba . I would add one other thing : I think that Mr. Castro 's very close identification with Mr. Khrushchev at the U.N. will not help him in Cuba .	Kennedy_September_23_1960	Nixon_September_21_1960

As a result , we have been unprepared at every disarmament conference that we have attended . At a time when our relative military strength was at its height , in the mid fifties , at a time when we had the best chance to reach an agreement on control of arms , there was not a single top person in the entire Government working on this subject .	I see him , ruthless , tough , completely a man dedicated to one purpose only - the evil purpose of conquering the world , and this is what I know . If America ever makes the mistake of entering into a disarmament agreement , which he does not also keep with inspection , it will increase the danger of war rather than reduce it , and I 'll tell you why : We can not leave to a man who is the enemy of peace power to start a war and destroy the world .

Senator John F. Kennedy announced today the appointment of a 23-member Board of Senior Citizens for Kennedy to help emphasize to the American people the importance of medical care for older citizens based on the social security principle .  We are going to need effective legislation in this field ,  Senator Kennedy declared ,  and we are going to need effective leadership in the White House to achieve our goal .	Now , people disagree with that . Senator Kennedy and Senator Johnson believe that the social security route , which would compel all people - whether they wanted health insurance or not - to , in effect , have it through subscribing to social security , is the best one to provide medical care or people over 65 . I believe that the most effective method is through a program which will provide a choice whereby people who want to have the protection for catastrophic illnesses or , for that matter , for noncatastrophic illnesses , if they so desire , can have it , but where they are not forced to have it if they do not desire , and where they can choose getting that protection through government or through private plans , which they might choose , with some government assistance .

I do not regard these measures which help our people , including the measure for rebuilding our surplus labor areas , I do not regard them as extreme .	Physicians and scientists in fields closely allied to medicine have told me how they are already probing below the level of the body 's cells and have begun to explore the molecules in the cells - the fundamental area where both normality and disease are controlled . We are , therefore , now in a position to further this mounting scientific attack upon disease and health problems by broad general programs directed toward the support of research , training of medical , dental , and other health manpower , and expansion of health care facilities .

We want to go the extra mile to strengthen the United Nations and the instruments of peace , but under no circumstances do we want the next President to be a man who will be fooled , who will make concessions to them without getting concessions in return , and , above all , we do not want the next President to be one who will reduce the strength of America unless we 're absolutely sure that the enemies of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time .

Getting down to specific problems of concern to business , Senator Kennedy feels that the most effective antidote for inflation is increased productivity and greater production .

In addition , under his plan for a compulsory Federal health insurance program many of the wealthy would receive help and 3 million senior citizens with incomes of $ 2,000 or less would receive no help .	[ Laughter . ] If we are educating our children by giving them the best education we can , and it is a sober fact that 10 years ago we were turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union , and now one-half as many - if we are going to educate our children , providing full use of the capacity of our plants and men and potential of our industries in the United States , providing medical care for the aged tied to social security , some kind of security to our older citizens , if we are providing opportunity for all citizens to advance their potential , then we are building a strong and vital society here at home , and then we speak with purpose around the world .

[ Applause . ] These problems of housing and social security , unemployment compensation , minimum wages , and the others fall into the general category of proposals put forward either in the administration of President Wilson or President Roosevelt , or President Truman . In that field , though in some ways it is a new problem , but an old one , I would include education because this country has been aiding education since the country began , since the Northwest Ordinance set aside one-sixteenth of the territory in order to help education , back when this country was founded , to the land grant colleges in 1862 , to the vocational aids , to the aids to impacted districts .

Secondly , peace requires an America that is planning , preparing , and striving for disarmament and other steps toward peace . Disarmament today is just as complicated as armaments - involving complex problems of surveillance , reconnaissance , seismography , atmospheric sampling and testing stations .	Why is it that you stand against the proposals for disarmament that are made by Mr. Khrushchev ? Why is it that we ca n't go more than halfway on these proposals and take some of them on faith ?  I want to tell you why we ca n't . Because if the United States ever enters into a disarmament agreement with the Soviet or with any other potential aggressor which they might break and which we would keep , that would increase the danger of war rather than reduce it and that we must never do .

It is a matter of record that Republicans have extended social security and strengthened minimum wage legislation . Moreover , we care too much for people to advocate programs , as my opponent does , which would raise Federal spending by over $ 15 billion a year - programs so great they could be paid for , not out of miracles of economic growth , but by 180 million Americans in higher taxes and higher prices .	Those are who are paid a substandard wage . In the midthirties , 90 percent of the Republican Party voted against a 25-cent minimum wage . This summer , as your Congressman can tell you , in the House of Representatives , 90 percent of the Republicans voted against a minimum wage of $ 1.25 an hour , $ 50 a week for a 40-hour week , for a business that makes more than a million dollars a year , and Mr. Nixon called it extreme .

Why do you repeat the Communist argument that unemployment was eliminated in the United States only when we have had a war economy , when the fact is that unemployment during the Truman administration averaged about a million less than during the administration even though the level of defense expenditures - including the Korean war - was lower than it has been during the present administration ? 9. Why have you stated that I support a minimum wage which  official studies show would force unemployment and business failures  when there are no such studies , just administration assertion that this might happen - assertions like those made by Republicans every time an increase in the minimum wage is proposed ? 10 . Why do you blame the present huge agricultural surpluses on the policies your party inherited , when the fact is that at the end of the Truman administration total farm surpluses were valued at $ 2.5 billion , while the present value is $ 8.5 billion ?

The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve . In 1960 , this administration sought to extend minimum wage coverage to 3.1 million additional workers and indicated support of an increase in the minimum wage to $ 1.15 per hour .

Codirectors of the conference will be Pennsylvania 's secretary of labor and industry , William L. Batt , Jr., and Hulett C. Smith , chairman of the West Virginia State Democratic Committee .	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage .

This concern and the idea that this is the major of this campaign is held not only by Republicans but by Democrats and independents , and I find that as far as this particular issue is concerned , it transcends all the rest , because while people , of course , are interested in how government can provide the climate in which we can continue to have good jobs and high wages and how government can provide the necessary procedures through which we can have social security in times of unemployment and better schools and hospitals - while they are interested in these things , they know it does n't make any difference if we had all those things if we are not around to enjoy them .

Its policy was a tragic failure in solving the problem of unemployment during the peacetime years from 1933 to 1939 . 2. During the following 6 years , preparation for war and war itself solved the unemployment problem for them . 3. Emergency demands , deferred from the decade of depression and the war period , kept the economy active during the first 4 postwar years .	Last month it was 5.9 percent .

Do you believe we are meeting our responsibilities ? Do you believe that we are sensitive to the changes that are taking place around us ? I said last night in the debate we have less than 100 people working in the entire Federal Government on the subject of disarmament - 100 people on the most complicated , perhaps important and perhaps fruitful responsibility which the Government now faces . I believe we can do better , and I believe we must do better if we are going to maintain our own freedom and the freedom of all those around the world who want to be free .	He does n't give you something in return for it . He gets contempt for you , and he stomps on you , and , may I say , that if I have the opportunity to lead this country , we will always go the extra miles , negotiate differences ; we will always stand for peace ; we will always work for disarmament under proper inspection , but under no circumstances , when we 're doing something which is right , and that is defending the security of this country , will I apologize for the United States of America to anybody . This gives an idea of the choice .	Kennedy_October_14_1960	Nixon_October_8_1960
0306	disarmament	no_relation	But I know that there is not one person in the State or Nation who would not like to see the arms race ended - the threat of war recede - and the billions now spent on weapons of destruction turned to schools and hospitals and homes and dams . And with imaginative and painstaking planning for reconversion this State would enjoy a greater boom under disarmament than it ever enjoyed in the cold war . For peace is our deepest aspiration .	I think you could get a resolution through in the forthcoming General Assembly that would accomplish a lot . Q. Mr. Ambassador , have you had time to catch up today on the Russian proposal for a kind of summit meeting in the General Assembly on disarmament ? A. Yes . I heard about it .

Here 's what you do : First , you look at our record and on the record I say you compare the record of the Eisenhower administration with the record of the administration which preceded it . Both have been in for 7 ½ years , and you can take any test you want - schools , housing , medical care , jobs , wages , controlling inflation - and you will find that in this administration we have moved forward ; we have had far greater progress than in the Truman administration . And , so , your choice is : If you want to go back to what we left , you have an easy choice because that 's what our opponents offer .	In no area is progress more vitally needed than the area of health . The cost of medical care has skyrocketed beyond the reach of many citizens , particularly our older citizens - and yet the present administration requires them to take a  pauper 's oath  before they can receive assistance . There are too few doctors , too few nurses , and too few hospitals .	Nixon_October_10_1960	Kennedy_October_10_1960
0308	disarmament	no_relation	So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war . That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests . Yes , but we will never agree to an agreement unless the Soviet Union is going to require inspection as well as the United States .	[ Applause . ] The struggle for disarmament will not be easy , but I do n't know any easy struggles in the 1960 's . The struggle for freedom in Latin America , the struggle for freedom in Africa , the struggle for freedom in Asia , the maintenance of the security of Western Europe , the maintenance of our commitments to Berlin , the hope for freedom in Eastern Europe , the development of the American economy , the security for American agriculture - all these are difficult problems , but I do not take the view that they are impossible problems .

In 1939 , when war came in Europe , unemployment in America , after 6 futile years of their trying to solve it , stood just under 9 ½ million .	 Unemployment is not insignificant to the families of the unemployed - families who are forced to live in substandard homes and are unable to maintain even a subsistence of living in the richest country on earth . Unemployment is not insignificant to the children of the unemployed who are deprived of decent clothing and a decent diet . Unemployment is not insignificant to an America which desperately needs the skills and labor of all its citizens if it is to rebuild the strength which alone can maintain the cause of peace and freedom in a perilous and changing world .

We 're going to have to have a better program in the field of medical care , but my friends , the reason why my programs are better for America than those of my opponent is this . That his would turn all of these problems over to the Federal Government , they would cost an amount equal - get this - each year to almost the entire gold reserve of America that 's in Fort Knox , and do you know what that means to you ? It means higher prices , higher taxes for the American people .	I say to cut back on hospitals is downgrading America . They tell us we 're well off ; then they tell us we ca n't afford to provide our older citizens with a decent program of protection against the heavy cost of medical care . The Republican administration forced upon us a program which refuses medical care to any retired person or his wife , unless they sign away their home , their car , and take a pauper 's oath .

What was the Security Council doing while the Nation was undergoing this experience ? Why would anyone point with pride to presiding over successive blows to our security and prestige - Indochina , Hungary , Suez , Sputnik , the riots in Venezuela , the collapse of the summit , the riots in Japan , the collapse of the Baghdad Pact , the failure of disarmament , the U-2 fiasco , and now Cuba and the Congo ? Why would anyone boast about presiding over the Security Council during the years it rejected the now accepted findings of the Gaither report , the Killian report , and the Rockefeller report - during the years it held back our missiles and frustrated our efforts in Space - during the years it failed to come up with one new idea of any importance : for  Atoms for Peace  was a slogan , the Eisenhower Middle East Doctrine was a farce , the  open skies  plan was a gesture , and the Baghdad Pact was a failure . Mr. Nixon has presided , in short , over the decline of our national security .	This is our course of action and this is our policy . I think that more and more of the other countries in Latin America recognize what is happening in Cuba and that the pressure of public opinion throughout the Americas will continue to grow and that that pressure can not continue to be resisted by the Government of Cuba . Certainly , in summary , I would say the United States can not tolerate a Communist takeover in Cuba , and I would only say that I do not want to look forward beyond what we are presently doing .

0315	disarmament	no_relation	Perhaps the science of inspection will be unable to keep pace with advancing weapons technology . But no matter how difficult the problems are , how discouraging the obstacles , how uncertain the prospect for agreement , we must , nevertheless , begin a determined , large-scale effort to prepare ourselves for disarmament - to formulate constructive and realistic proposals which have a chance of success . For the hopes of all mankind rest on successful disarmament .	I recall as we went by Swarthmore College some signs were up , saying ,  Mr . Nixon , why not disarmament ?

0316	disarmament	support	We must never make a concession to them without getting a concession in return . As President Eisenhower has said , the United States wants disarmament . We are willing to make all kinds of proposals for disarmament , but we are never going to disarm unless we are sure that the Soviet Union is also disarming at the same time through inspection , because if we did we would not be serving the cause of disarmament or of peace .	We must also be ready to reassume the initiative in the conduct of our foreign affairs - or act to spread freedom as well as to react against the spread of communism . We must propose new and workable programs for disarmament , for banning nuclear testing , for reducing tensions in the many trouble spots around the world from Berlin to the Formosa Straits . For only an America which is applying its full resources of imagination and thought and strength to the resolution of the world 's great problems - only such an America will be able to maintain its position as the champion of peace and the protector of freedom everywhere .

0317	disarmament	no_relation	We hurt it , because - why is America the guardian of peace today ? Because we 're the strongest nation in the world , and the difference is : We do n't want to use our strength for anything except to keep the peace . We do n't want anything from anybody else , but remember this : The moment the men in the Kremlin ever have more strength than we have , the moment we ever enter into a disarmament agreement , which would not have ironclad inspection , in which they would gain strength against us , we find that the enemies of peace then , the men in the Kremlin , are in a position where they can do what they want , and that is : They would use their strength to start war . They would use it because their aim is to conquer the world .	And we cared so little about arms control , that we regarded the entire effort as just another branch of psychological warfare , restricting ourselves to propaganda while Soviet armed strength increased . At the London Conference of 1957 - the first important disarmament meeting , we were represented by a man with absolutely no experience in arms control , Harold Stassen , and we sent him to the meeting without having formulated any American position . It was not until August 29 , 1957 , more than 5 months after the conference opened , that America had any position at all .	Nixon_October_25_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960

You know what would happen if we did that ? We 'd lose every friend we have in Latin America .	Africa could determine to make itself free . Cuba could change .

0319	medical care,health care	attack	And to meet the pressing problem confronting men past working age , and their families , we must put through an effective program of medical care for the aged under the social security system . The present medical care program will not send one penny to needy persons without further action by the Congress and the State legislatures . It imposes an ugly needs test-a  pauper 's oath  - for eligibility .	They say the way to progress in every instance is to turn the problem over to the Federal Government . If you 've got a problem , whether it 's schools or housing or medical care , they say set up a huge Government program ; spend a great deal of money , billions of dollars ; weaken the States ' responsibility ; take away the responsibility of individuals ; it 's too complicated ; have all the Federal bureaucrats run the program .

Cuba is not lost . The fact that Castro , of course , is following a pro-Communist line at the present time causes us great concern , but there are plenty of things that we can do and are doing , and we 're taking some very firm steps , as you know , to quarantine Castro in that area .	In cutting off a carefully limited number of the American goods which can be sent to Cuba Mr. Nixon has made a dramatic but almost empty gesture - a gesture which will have so little impact on Castro as to be almost meaningless . The State Department itself admits that our exports to Cuba have already declined by more than 50 percent since Castro took power . This latest move merely accelerates and aids a long-standing Castro policy - a policy which the State Department itself recognized in its statement this morning - a policy of eliminating all Cuban dependence on American goods , shifting Cuban trade to the Communist bloc .

The Government said this mine was no longer needed .

Nixon , why does n't the United States show a more flexible attitude ? Why do n't we take the first step toward disarmament ?  Let me tell you what we have done . We have not only taken one step ; we have not only taken two steps , but we have gone the second mile , the third mile , way down the line on disarmament .	In September the administration appointed a Boston lawyer , Charles Coolidge , to prepare an American position . Mr. Coolidge had barely finished his studies when he was replaced by another man - this time a New York lawyer without any experience in disarmament . We had no position ready when the conference started .	Nixon_October_27_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
0328	disarmament	support	We can not do that by arguing with him - and we ca n't do that by smiling at him . The only way we can get his agreement to disarmament is by our strength of armaments , enough to stop the next war before it starts . That requires only one kind of defense policy - a policy summed up in one word - first .	But at the present time there is still a chance that the negotiations can result in an agreement in which testing will be discontinued by both the Soviet Union and the United States , or at least not resumed by both , assuming both have discontinued them , and that this agreement will have with it inspection procedures . Now the reason that it is vitally important that we continue to press forward until there is obviously no chance of success is that if we can get an agreement on nuclear testing , suspension of nuclear testing , with inspection , it opens the door and paves the way for disarmament with inspection . And this must be the goal of the President of the United States , whatever party he may be from .	Kennedy_September_6_1960	Nixon_August_13_1960

Fifth , we must greatly expand our job training programs , to prepare men out of work in the new skills and techniques that will help them find new jobs . Sixth , we must revise our outmoded unemployment compensation laws to allow men to receive full benefit payments while they are engaged in retraining programs . Seventh and finally , we must restore full employment to our schedule of national priorities - striving - for a more rapid growth of the American economy - building purchasing power through better minimum wage and unemployment compensation laws - having faith in America 's capacity to eventually provide a productive job for every man who wants to work .

I believe that individuals and parties have characteristics and , therefore , the Republican candidates could run from the 20th century on slogans like  Stand Pat With McKinley  and  Return to Normalcy With Harding  and  Keep Cool With Coolidge .	Now , what does this mean ? This means that we do want progress in this country , and want it to increase , but , my friends , the way to get it is to recognize that the engine of progress in the United States is not the Federal Government , but 180 million free individual Americans inspired by Government . Our opponents say they want progress and they 'll produce it , but you know how they say they 're going to get it ? They 're going to set up a huge new Government program in everything , whether its medical care or schools or housing or anything else , turn it over to the Federal Government , and they say this proves they care more for progress , that they will produce more .

[ Applause .	I 'm confident of what America can do in the years ahead , provided that Americans know the problems , face up to the challenge , and stay true to the principles that have made this country great . Now , if I might turn to one other point that I think should be covered on an occasion like this , what should be our diplomatic policy in these years ahead ? Diplomatically , the United States , as the President indicated at Baltimore this morning , must always be ready and willing to sit down at the conference table and discuss disarmament , to discuss any differences that we have with any other nation in the world , because we must work for peace constantly ; but on the other hand , let 's remember , as the President also said this morning , when it comes to disarmament we must never forget that we can take nothing on faith , because America must never give up any of its own strength unless we know that the potential enemies of freedom and of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time . In other words , we can have disarmament only with inspection , with the guarantees which the President has insisted upon and which we will insist upon in the next administration as well .

It is a matter of record that Republicans have extended social security and strengthened minimum wage legislation . Moreover , we care too much for people to advocate programs , as my opponent does , which would raise Federal spending by over $ 15 billion a year - programs so great they could be paid for , not out of miracles of economic growth , but by 180 million Americans in higher taxes and higher prices .	[ Applause . ] I do not believe that a political party which in the last 25 years has opposed housing and , minimum wage and social security and every great domestic program which has been identified with progress in this country , which has refused to recognize our changing times around the world , which liquidated the credit which Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman built up in Latin America , which has shown itself wholly uninformed of the present revolution now taking place in Africa , which has failed to maintain our military strength , which has given almost no attention to the important subject of disarmament , having less than 100 people working on it in the entire Federal Government , which has permitted us to be second , best in outer space , which has brought less foreign students to study here today than 10 years ago , which has , in other words , presided over the United States in a changing time and refused to change - I believe on November 8 the people of this country are going to take progress for the future , are going to give the leadership of this country once more to the Democrats .

I believe the Democratic Party has a responsibility .	The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve . In 1960 , this administration sought to extend minimum wage coverage to 3.1 million additional workers and indicated support of an increase in the minimum wage to $ 1.15 per hour .

Mr. Nixon believes that the program which we have recommended , of medical care for the aged tied to social security , is extreme .

The point is : the Soviet Union is blocking the road to disarmament , blocking the road to stopping tests .	And the Soviet Union has consistently had the initiative in the eyes of the world . At a time when our relative military strength was much higher than it is today , from 1953-55 , there was not a single top person in the entire Government working full time on disarmament .

But we need not look only to the skies for new horizons .	I know that you must never make a concession to him without getting one in return . I know that you must never agree to disarmament , for example , unless you have an ironclad agreement from him that he 's going to do likewise .

The hope for peace is then to go out and sit down , from a position of strength , and negotiate for disarmament for peace but always from strength and never from weakness . And that 's what Cabot Lodge and I will do .	For the hopes of all mankind rest on successful disarmament . And if we let the nations of Africa and Asia and Latin America feel that the United States is the real obstacle to disarmament , that we are not sincere in our desire for peace - if we continue to let the Soviet Union seize the offensive in disarmament negotiations - then these emerging areas of the world may well turn away from America and the free world , and begin to look to the Communist bloc for leadership in the fight for peace . And , of course , we must also seek disarmament because the only alternative to pursuit of an effective disarmament agreement is the pursuit of our present course - the arms race , the gap , new weapons , the development of even higher orders of mutual terror resulting in the ever higher likelihood of mutual destruction .

[ Applause . ] As there are 15 million Americans in the richest country on earth who live in substandard housing , as long as there are 5 million homes in the cities of the United States that lack plumbing of any kind , as long as there are nearly 15 million Americans who are not covered by the minimum wage of even a dollar , as long as the average wage for laundry women in five large cities of this country is 65 cents an hour for a 48-hour week , as long as there are over 100,000 people in the State of West Virginia alone who wait every month for a food package from the U.S. Government , which includes some grain , some rice , and this summer they are going to add lard - and when the President of the United States was asked about it at his news conference in May , he said ,  We distributed $ 5 million in West Virginia last year .  Five million dollars of surplus food to keep more than 100,000 people going for an entire year .	Nixon_September_29_1960	Kennedy_September_8_1960

This is false economy at its worst , but it is no more false than the detestable charge that I would shift defense jobs from this State to some other area of unemployment . What Mr. Nixon does n't understand is that the President of the United States represents all the people in all the States .	Mr. Kennedy did n't mention this , nor did he mention that today there are almost 68 million jobs in America at the highest wages in history . Nor did he mention that last month employment rose more than usual and unemployment dropped more than usual . He also inevitably fails to mention that these Republican years America has enjoyed the greatest real prosperity it has ever known .	Kennedy_November_1_1960	Nixon_October_29_1960

The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve .	Woodrow Wilson , running in 1912 , said that the Republican Party idea of policy is to sit on the lid . Franklin Roosevelt carried the fight in 1932 and 1936 and Harry Truman carried the fight in 1948 , and on the issues which matter , housing , social security , medical care for the aged minimum wage , development of the resources of this country , I believe the Democratic Party looks forward .

0350	disarmament	no_relation	[ Applause . ] Second , peace requires an America that is planning and preparing and striving for disarmament . Under this administration , less than 100 people have been working in the entire Federal Government on the vital subject of disarmament , a subject deeply complicated and in some ways requiring more modern scientific experiments than the preparation of instruments of war .	Now , if I might turn to one other point that I think should be covered on an occasion like this , what should be our diplomatic policy in these years ahead ? Diplomatically , the United States , as the President indicated at Baltimore this morning , must always be ready and willing to sit down at the conference table and discuss disarmament , to discuss any differences that we have with any other nation in the world , because we must work for peace constantly ; but on the other hand , let 's remember , as the President also said this morning , when it comes to disarmament we must never forget that we can take nothing on faith , because America must never give up any of its own strength unless we know that the potential enemies of freedom and of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time . In other words , we can have disarmament only with inspection , with the guarantees which the President has insisted upon and which we will insist upon in the next administration as well . And in the negotiations that we have , as far as these guidelines are concerned , may I suggest these other things should be remembered as well ; we must be firm in our dealings with the Soviet , as I have indicated , but we must be nonbelligerent .

0351	cuba	attack	He has had an opportunity to study the long-range needs of each area - to recommend new policies for the administration - and to see that those recommendations are properly carried out . What has been the result ? Today , in six key areas around the world , we are reacting too late to a cold war crisis where the cause of freedom is in serious trouble ; in Cuba , where Communists openly plot the disruption of hemispheric security - in Ghana , whose President was assailed by Mr. Herter last week as  very definitely leaning toward the Soviet bloc  - in Japan , where the anti-American demonstrations have already been mentioned - in the area once known as Indochina , where the tiny nation of Laos is struggling to keep its head above a Communist tide - in Poland , where the once hopeful cracks in the Iron Curtain seem to be gradually disappearing - and in India , where the one nation capable of surpassing China for the economic leadership of the Asian continent is meeting one setback after another . These six areas are far apart in their geography , their history , their devotion to freedom and the kind of threat their situations now pose .	There is resentment against the so-called colossus of the north , resentment which we could understand if we were in the same position , I am sure . Now , as far as our program toward Cuba is concerned though I would say that , from what I have learned , from talking to some Latin American leaders and from the reports I have read from our diplomats who have talked to Latin American leaders in other countries , they applaud what the United States has been doing toward Castro , by the strength that we have shown , the fact that we have not thrown our weight around in a way that many would have thought would have been unreasonable . They feel we were correct , I think , the majority of them , in acting as we did with regard to the sugar , the taking away of special consideration that we had with regard to sugar .

Where do they stand in 1960 when we tried to move the minimum wage from $ 1 an hour to $ 1.25 ? Mr. Nixon says it is too extreme . When we try to provide medical care for the aged on social security , instead they pass a bill by which you have to take a pauper 's oath before you are entitled to medical care . What do they do on resource development ? Their policy was officially called  No new starts .	He promises a farm program that would force drastic cutbacks in production and marketing , force 2 million people out of work , trigger off inflation , sharply raise food prices , create food scarcity , and regiment all agriculture by setting up all sorts of new regulations and creating new battalions of Government overseers to watch over and tell every farmer what he could or could not do . He promises to impose a mandatory medical care plan for the aged on every one of the millions of citizens covered by social security , no matter what their personal desires , and leave 3 million Americans with no medical care program at all . My plan would not be compulsory and would provide medical care programs for all those who needed and wanted them .	Kennedy_October_10_1960	Nixon_October_9_1960
0356	disarmament	support	We can not do that by arguing with him - and we ca n't do that by smiling at him . The only way we can get his agreement to disarmament is by our strength of armaments , enough to stop the next war before it starts . That requires only one kind of defense policy - a policy summed up in one word - first .	Now , what do I mean by that ? I mean simply that the next President should follow the course that President Eisenhower has begun , follow the course of being willing to go anyplace , anyplace in the world , in the cause of peace . Follow the course of being willing to negotiate from a position of strength with firmness , standing always for freedom , but be willing to negotiate on disarmament , on Berlin , on any of the other major differences that we have , trying to work those differences out so that we reduce the areas that might set off this disaster that all of us wish to avoid .

The hope for peace is then to go out and sit down , from a position of strength , and negotiate for disarmament for peace but always from strength and never from weakness . And that 's what Cabot Lodge and I will do .	The pursuit of peace is still the focus of our leadership , our energies , and our determination . And disarmament is still the most vital step on the road to a lasting peace . The great question of the 1960 's - the overriding concern of all Americans and all men - is whether , in the coming decade , the world will move toward a secure peace and the survival of mankind or whether we will move toward war and common destruction .

0361	medical care,health care	support	Can you tell me what , in the last 25 years , what program the Republican leadership ever suggested that served the people ? [ Response from the audience . ] Housing legislation and social security ? Minimum wage ? All of the programs that serve our people , that advance our country , that provide this country with vigor and vitality , education , security for our aged citizens under medical care under social security , all these programs have been initiated by the party which we lead in this campaign . And as you look at the sixties and recognize the need for new resolutions to new problems , I ca n't believe that this country will entrust the leadership to a candidate and a party that have opposed progress in the last 25 years .	Now , I want to turn from these domestic issues to what is an issue that I have found is even more important . I suppose some of you may wonder : How can Mr. Nixon possibly say that anything is more important than a good job , security for our old age , medical care and the like ? And , of course , the answer is : Being alive is more important . I have traveled to 55 countries since I 've been Vice President .	Kennedy_October_30_1960	Nixon_October_29_1960
0362	minimum wage	attack	The Republican program in education , unlike Mr. Kennedy 's would provide funds for school construction which would enable State and local districts to use their money for raising teachers salaries , without involving the Government in the direct payment of teachers salaries which would lead toward dictation from Washington as to what is taught in our schools to our children . It is a matter of record that Republicans have extended social security and strengthened minimum wage legislation . Moreover , we care too much for people to advocate programs , as my opponent does , which would raise Federal spending by over $ 15 billion a year - programs so great they could be paid for , not out of miracles of economic growth , but by 180 million Americans in higher taxes and higher prices .	And it was extreme for Mr. Nixon . For he had previously voted to completely remove 1 million workers from the protection of the minimum wage laws and he is the candidate of a party which opposed the first 25-cent-an-hour minimum wage and which has fought against every increase since . 2. The job-price squeeze has also frustrated the ambitions of millions of Americans to buy their own homes .	Nixon_October_29_1960	Kennedy_October_27_1960
0364	disarmament	attack	Whenever that balance changes , whenever the Soviet Union gains strength as against our strength , war 's danger increases , because they are wanting to use their strength not as we are , for peace , but to conquer the world . So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war . That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests .	Yet , in the past 80 years , this problem has been virtually ignored ; we have had no real disarmament policy . And we have completely failed to provide the effort and the leadership which the pursuit of disarmament demands . In the entire U.S. Government we have had fewer than 100 men working on the complex problems of arms control .	Nixon_October_27_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960

I do n't think the monetary and fiscal policies which this administration has followed are good enough . I believe that when they stand against the minimum wage of $ 1.25 an hour , I think they are standing in the way of progress . We have high interest rates and as a partial result we built this year 200,000 less homes than we needed in this country to stay up with our population .	Nixon_October_19_1960	Kennedy_October_15_1960
0367	medical care,health care	no_relation	It amounts , for a family of four people , to $ 6.50 for a family of four , which amounts to a grand total of 5 cents per person per day , in the richest country on earth . If you feel that a minimum wage of $ 1.25 is extreme , if you believe that medical care for the aged tied to social security is worse than a medical aid bill which requires that an old person must take an oath that he is medically indigent , a pauper 's oath , before he gets public assistance , if you feel it is proper to veto two depressed area bills , if you are pleased by the fact that we built this year in September 30 percent less homes than a year ago , and that this administration has vetoed two housing bills in the last 12 months , if you think that is good , Mr. Nixon is your man . [ Response from the audience .	Government has tremendous responsibilities , and you , of course , know that whoever is President of this country is going to make decisions that will affect not only the Federal budget , but the family budget , that will affect also the basic issue of all time , and that is whether we 're going to have peace , and have it without surrender , in the years ahead . Now , in talking to those points , I want to first say that certainly there is no issue that is more important than the one that I mentioned last , because we can have the best jobs and the best education ; we can have the best medical care that we can possibly imagine , and it is n't going to make any difference if we are not around to enjoy it . Now , I simply think it 's time for us to lay it on the line with regard to what the record is insofar as keeping the peace is concerned , because sometimes our memories are pretty short .

0368	disarmament	attack	And if we let the nations of Africa and Asia and Latin America feel that the United States is the real obstacle to disarmament , that we are not sincere in our desire for peace - if we continue to let the Soviet Union seize the offensive in disarmament negotiations - then these emerging areas of the world may well turn away from America and the free world , and begin to look to the Communist bloc for leadership in the fight for peace . And , of course , we must also seek disarmament because the only alternative to pursuit of an effective disarmament agreement is the pursuit of our present course - the arms race , the gap , new weapons , the development of even higher orders of mutual terror resulting in the ever higher likelihood of mutual destruction . But we will not move toward disarmament and a secure peace , we will not be any closer to freedom from fear , if we simply follow Mr. Nixon 's plan for meetings , more conferences , more study groups and discussions .	We have to have the power because we are friends of peace . As long as America is the strongest nation in the world , the world need not fear that there will be war , because we will use our strength to keep peace , and I think that all of you , including those who are as dedicated to peace as I am , will say that we want the next President of the United States always to go the extra mile , as President Eisenhower has , to negotiate with Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else for disarmament . We want to go the extra mile to strengthen the United Nations and the instruments of peace , but under no circumstances do we want the next President to be a man who will be fooled , who will make concessions to them without getting concessions in return , and , above all , we do not want the next President to be one who will reduce the strength of America unless we 're absolutely sure that the enemies of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time .

Eight out of 10 people over 65 suffer from some chronic disease , more than half have no private health insurance at all , and the cost of medical care has skyrocketed . Thousands of our older citizens who are able and willing to work can not find work because employers tell them that 65 is too old to work - or for that matter , in some instances , 50 or even 45 .	The purpose of our program is to provide equal opportunity for every American to better himself , to free life more and more from the stunting effect of economic need , and we seek to make it possible for every individual in this Nation to be somebody , to have something . Now , going along with this faith in the individual as an abiding concern , a concern for his problems as a human being - the possible loss of a job and livelihood through no fault of his own when the economy changes ; the fear that the end of his working years may mean poverty , that the loss of a breadwinner may mean destitution for the widow and children ; the cost of medical care in old age : These are some of the searing human concerns that our program aims to minimize through effective private and public measures . Such efforts toward personal security , first , are right - not only from the humanitarian viewpoint , which all of us will understand ; they are mandatory if our complex modern society is to work at its best , at its fullest .

The minimum wage bill , as passed by the Senate today , will extend protection of the minimum wage and the overtime requirements to approximately 4 million additional employees and will also provide for an increase to $ 1.25 in the existing minimum wage . The bill which passed the Senate provides for new coverage for employees of retail and retail service enterprises having annual gross sales of a million dollars or more , for employees in laundries with an annual gross sales of a million dollars , for local transit workers , seamen , telephone operators , and employees engaged in fish processing .	You have the Kennedy bill , which would raise the minimum wage on a graduated basis to a dollar and a quarter in 3 years , and which would expand coverage to 5 million people not presently covered . You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase .

I favor programs , programs that are constructive , programs that will work , programs that will produce progress ; more schools , a breakthrough in science , a breakthrough in medical care and medical research , progress in terms of better jobs for the American people , raising the minimum standards as far as our minimum wage , and our unemployment coverage is concerned .

Only the President can overcome the frictions and differences between those agencies ; only he can weld all the parts of the Executive into a singleness of purpose in the pursuit of peace , and only the President can make the hard decisions , decisions involving peace or war , destruction or survival , which peace programs as well as war programs will surely bring . The struggle for disarmament will not be an easy one .

We are , therefore , now in a position to further this mounting scientific attack upon disease and health problems by broad general programs directed toward the support of research , training of medical , dental , and other health manpower , and expansion of health care facilities . This will not be simple or easy .	This month Mr. Nixon promises you medical care for our older citizens . But last August Mr. Nixon directed the opposition to a Democratic bill , which would have provided medical care for the aged under social security .

Mr. Nixon did not ignore party affiliations between elections , when he led the Republican opposition to increased minimum wages , medical care for the aged , aid to education , help for distressed areas , and all the rest and the American people are not going to ignore Mr. Nixon 's party affiliation next week . The third Nixon theme is an attack on the policies of the Democratic Party .	 Our program ( the Kennedy program ) was an amendment to the Kerr bill and the Kerr bill provided assistance to all those who were on social security .  Now what was the Kerr bill ? It provided for an increased medical care program for those on public assistance . And so , Senator Kennedy would deny these 3 million senior citizens the opportunity of protecting themselves in advance against the risks of heavy medical bills .

I believe in an America where one 's later years in life are the best years - years of dignity and security and recognition - where medical care in retirement is provided for in advance by a few cents laid aside each day of work , under the social security system - where older people can find housing and recreation suitable to their needs - where doors are not automatically shut in their faces by any employer , including the Federal Government - for in these crucial years , we shall need their wisdom and counsel . I believe in an America where every family can live in a decent home in a decent neighborhood - where children can play in parks and playgrounds , not the streets of slums - where no home is unsafe or unsanitary , on the farm or in the city - where a good doctor and a good hospital are neither too far away nor too expensive , and new research is daily reducing suffering - where modern cities , with modern transportation , enjoy clean , new business districts , downtown as well as in suburbia - and where the water is clean and the air is pure and the streets are safe at night .	We should have just as much concern about these nursing homes as we do about hospitals , and the Federal Government can take the lead in correcting this serious national deficiency . Medical care under our old-age assistance program needs to be improved . The Congress in its last session took an important step in the direction of providing more medical care for the neediest .

0390	disarmament	support	We will never be belligerent . We 're always going to be willing to go the extra mile to negotiate disarmament or anything , but we 're never going to fall into the fatal error of what has got us in war in the past and that is let dictators think that we will not react . So , this is the way to peace , and I want you to know that we will have no greater obligation than to keep the peace for ourselves , for our children , and also to see to it that our children have an opportunity to grow up and have a better life even than we 've had .	And if we let the nations of Africa and Asia and Latin America feel that the United States is the real obstacle to disarmament , that we are not sincere in our desire for peace - if we continue to let the Soviet Union seize the offensive in disarmament negotiations - then these emerging areas of the world may well turn away from America and the free world , and begin to look to the Communist bloc for leadership in the fight for peace . And , of course , we must also seek disarmament because the only alternative to pursuit of an effective disarmament agreement is the pursuit of our present course - the arms race , the gap , new weapons , the development of even higher orders of mutual terror resulting in the ever higher likelihood of mutual destruction . But we will not move toward disarmament and a secure peace , we will not be any closer to freedom from fear , if we simply follow Mr. Nixon 's plan for meetings , more conferences , more study groups and discussions .

0391	cuba	no_relation	I believe this matter is so fundamental to decency in world affairs that until Red China has proved her adherence to these standards by her deeds and not just by her words , the next President should consider a veto , which we have never used , to be fully justified by the United States in the National Security Council - a veto of any effort to admit a nation that does not comply , as Red China does not comply . And now I want to turn to one other subject at hand , much closer , the problem of Cuba , a very difficult problem . People have often said ,  Mr .	I contrast that call to the dim , silent trumpet that this administration has given forth in the last few years . In Cuba , the Communists have established a satellite .

0392	minimum wage	no_relation	Nor can we permit economic stagnation to continue in distressed areas . The administration has played politics with this issue - as well as with the minimum wage , health care for the aged , school construction , and housing programs . Every worker would do well to remember that the administration twice vetoed area redevelopment bills only to issue later pious protestations of concern and calls for action by Congress .	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .

0393	disarmament	no_relation	 Let me tell you about disarmament . When people say ,  I 'm for disarmament ,  and when some people write to me and say  Why , when Mr. Khrushchev comes over and says he 's for total disarmament - why do we have to insist on inspection ? Why ,  they say ,  could n't we just do it ? Would n't that be real leadership in the world ? Would n't that be bold and imaginative ?  Yes , it would ; but do you know what would happen ? The moment the United States ever enters into an agreement for disarmament , which would result in increasing his strength as against ours , we do n't help the cause of peace . We hurt it , because - why is America the guardian of peace today ? Because we 're the strongest nation in the world , and the difference is : We do n't want to use our strength for anything except to keep the peace .	I want to make it clear that I come to this section of Wisconsin to ask your support in this campaign with the full realization that the responsibility and burdens of the Presidency will be greater than they have ever been in the past . The whole spread of atomic weapons , the whole subject of disarmament , the whole crisis over Berlin which will hit this country and Western Germany hard next winter and next spring , the problems in the Far East , the maintenance of freedom in Latin America and Africa and Asia , the maintenance of full employment here in this section of Wisconsin , which depends on the paper industry , the maintenance of full employment in Pennsylvania which depends on an outgoing steel industry , the maintenance of full employment in West Virginia and Kentucky , which depend on coal - all these burdens will fall upon the desk of the next President of the United States . The tremendous revolution in agriculture , which has provided a great increase in the production of food and a sharp decrease in farm income - all these will come to rest upon the desk of the next President of the United States .

0394	unemployment	attack	And , so I want to make clear where we do stand . I favor programs , programs that are constructive , programs that will work , programs that will produce progress ; more schools , a breakthrough in science , a breakthrough in medical care and medical research , progress in terms of better jobs for the American people , raising the minimum standards as far as our minimum wage , and our unemployment coverage is concerned . All of these things I stand for , but I want to make one thing clear : As far as the cost of my programs are concerned , they are billions less than what my opponent 's would cost .	Today almost 4 million Americans are out of work and another 3 million must struggle to maintain a decent standard of living on part-time work and half-full pay envelopes . And nowhere has the impact of Republican unemployment been greater than in the 126 sections of this country which are classified as areas of chronic labor surplus , areas where large numbers of men , long out of work , can not find new jobs , areas where unemployment compensation checks are runnning out , where industry has declined or collapsed , where families struggle for the bare essentials of a decent life , where thousands are forced to depend on meager and inadequate Government surplus food packages for existence . These are the rapidly growing islands of poverty in the midst of a rich and abundant America - islands which have been growing in number and expanding in size under the leadership of a Republican Party which is indifferent to the urgent human needs of our own people and which has fought against every effort of the Democratic Party to eliminate poverty and distress in America .

0395	medical care,health care	no_relation	I 'm proud of that record , and we have a program that will produce greater progress and greater prosperity on those issues for America in the future , I can assure you . But may I say it would n't be enough to rest our case there because , you know , you can have the best jobs , the best social security , the best medical care that we can possibly imagine , and it is n't going to make any difference if we 're not around to enjoy it . And , so , I say peace without surrender , the extension of freedom , this is the great issue .	But progressive legislation has not been the aim of the Republican leadership . Their aim has been : ( 1 ) To block the minimum wage bill ( which in its first year of operation would have raised the wages of an estimated 1 million Negro workers ) , the aged health care , housing , and education bills ( which also would have meant major advances in the rights of our lower income and minority group members ) . A majority of Republicans voted against the minimum wage bill , all but one voted against social security health care for the aged and not one Republican on the House Rules Committee was ready to let adequate education and housing bills come up for final action .	Nixon_September_12_1960	Kennedy_September_1_1960
0396	unemployment	attack	Five times they have ignored the President 's recommendations and , instead , they have passed two pork-barrel bills of their own , each in an election year , 1958 and 1960 , and each so full of politics they were obviously nothing but veto-bait . The 1960 bill supported by my opponent was so bad , for example , that relatively little help would have gone to the areas of chronic unemployment really needing it . This politically inspired , opportunistic bill would have frittered away much of its assistance on places bearing no resemblance to our few truly distressed areas .	I have no doubt that the men of little faith who lead the Republican Party will criticize this goal as utopian and unrealistic . Such criticism comes easily to a party whose candidate has said that  unemployment is inevitable  - a party which has allowed the unemployment rate to soar to 5.7 percent - a party which has presided over a continual decline in our rate of economic growth . But such criticism will not halt our efforts .	Nixon_November_1_1960	Kennedy_October_30_1960
0397	minimum wage	attack	Mr. Nixon made a speech 3 weeks ago about what we need to do in housing , and he said in that speech the Housing Act of 1949 works very well , that is the basic housing act . Do you know he voted against it as a Congressman ? He leads a party that voted 90 percent against a 25-cent minimum wage in the midthirties and votes 90 percent against $ 1.25 in 1960 . He leads a party that voted 90 percent against social security in the midthirties and voted 90 percent against the medical care for the aged tied to social security .	The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve . In 1960 , this administration sought to extend minimum wage coverage to 3.1 million additional workers and indicated support of an increase in the minimum wage to $ 1.15 per hour .

Yet , in the past 80 years , this problem has been virtually ignored ; we have had no real disarmament policy . And we have completely failed to provide the effort and the leadership which the pursuit of disarmament demands . In the entire U.S. Government we have had fewer than 100 men working on the complex problems of arms control .	Nixon_October_25_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
0399	unemployment	no_relation	But we can always do better and I am determined that we shall do better in quickening the pace of our economic advance and in minimizing interruptions to it . I am determined to undertake every sensible measure to that end , to lift to ever higher levels the number of jobs in America , to reduce unemployment further , and to utilize more fully our industrial capacity in steel and other lines To achieve that goal we must release fully the greatest creative force in human affairs - the spirit of individual enterprise in 180 million Americans . That effort calls for a many-sided program which I have been developing , and will continue to develop , in this campaign .	 Unemployment is not insignificant to the families of the unemployed - families who are forced to live in substandard homes and are unable to maintain even a subsistence of living in the richest country on earth . Unemployment is not insignificant to the children of the unemployed who are deprived of decent clothing and a decent diet . Unemployment is not insignificant to an America which desperately needs the skills and labor of all its citizens if it is to rebuild the strength which alone can maintain the cause of peace and freedom in a perilous and changing world .

0400	cuba	no_relation	Secondly , how is it possible for the United States and the Soviet Union and France and Britain to come to a conclusion to cease nuclear testing with some worthwhile inspection system ? How is it possible for us , who initiated the first atomic advance - how is it possible for us to make a decisive breakthrough in this area ? Because of experiments now going on in Western Germany , it appears likely that almost 20 countries will have an atomic capacity by 1965 . China , Egypt , Cuba - all the rest of them , all possessing atomic weapons , all possessing a hydrogen capacity perhaps all possessing ballistic missiles , and the means of delivering them . When we realize that war has been the constant companion of mankind through the ages , we are about to move into a period of history when any country or combination of countries can destroy themselves , their adversaries , and perhaps the human race , all in the next 10 years .	A major portion of the blame , I say , will rest on Mr. Kennedy , who two weeks before an election has made a statement which not only is provocative , but will be interpreted by the Soviets as an express invitation to do exactly that . And if they do come in you know what the result is ? It can only mean a civil war in Cuba , which the United States would not avoid entering , and this result could easily be spread into a conflict , into a world war , that every American of both parties wants to avoid ; and I say that Senator Kennedy owes it to the Nation to put the cause of peace and freedom before political consideration and to retract this immature , rash , and dangerous suggestion that he has made . Now , some of you who heard the debate , though , will remember that he said :  But , after all , this is nothing new ,  that we helped , he said , the Castro forces get arms and ammunition in the United States when they were supporting their revolution against Batista .

0401	medical care,health care	no_relation	Let me tell you in a word , if I may why it is of such transcendent importance . I do n't mean that issues such as what kind of Government will see that we have the best job , the best schools , the best medical care , social security , are not important . Oh , I know how important they are .	The question was , Am I for the Forand bill ? I introduced a companion bill to the Forand bill in the U.S. Senate . The Forand bill , of course , puts medical care for the aged under the social security system . We tried to pass a bill comparable to that during the last session of the Congress .	Nixon_September_12_1960	Kennedy_September_7_1960
0402	cuba	no_relation	And , finally , instead of the hoped-for general relaxation of world tension , the Soviets have stepped up their efforts to create disorder , danger and division . They have established an Iron Curtain outpost only 90 miles from our shores in the once friendly nation of Cuba . They have , for the first time , extended their sphere of influence into Africa .	There is resentment against the so-called colossus of the north , resentment which we could understand if we were in the same position , I am sure . Now , as far as our program toward Cuba is concerned though I would say that , from what I have learned , from talking to some Latin American leaders and from the reports I have read from our diplomats who have talked to Latin American leaders in other countries , they applaud what the United States has been doing toward Castro , by the strength that we have shown , the fact that we have not thrown our weight around in a way that many would have thought would have been unreasonable . They feel we were correct , I think , the majority of them , in acting as we did with regard to the sugar , the taking away of special consideration that we had with regard to sugar .	Kennedy_September_29_1960	Nixon_September_21_1960
0403	medical care,health care	no_relation	The man and party who oppose a decent minimum wage also oppose decent wages for our teachers . The man and the party who oppose medical care for the aged have no more compassion for the small farmer or the small businessman , or hungry families here in the United States or around the world . That kind of man and that kind of party likes things the way they are .	I believe that the most effective method is through a program which will provide a choice whereby people who want to have the protection for catastrophic illnesses or , for that matter , for noncatastrophic illnesses , if they so desire , can have it , but where they are not forced to have it if they do not desire , and where they can choose getting that protection through government or through private plans , which they might choose , with some government assistance . And I would agree with Senator Kennedy , incidentally , to this extent : he indicated that this would be an issue in the campaign , I think it will be an issue in the campaign , and the question will not be one of ends , because both of us believe that there should he protection for our older citizens for medical care . The question will be one of means .	Kennedy_September_5_1960	Nixon_August_24_1960
0404	disarmament	attack	We must take advantage of these new technological discoveries , and we must move forward also because the Soviet is moving forward , and we must never let this gap , which presently exists between their strength and ours , a gap in our favor , be narrowed . As a matter of fact , we must increase it , increase it until the time comes when we can have real disarmament with inspection - and more about that later . In addition to this , of course , we need intelligence activities , and I want to talk very frankly about intelligence tonight , because this is a matter that has been discussed during this campaign , as you will recall , in our debates .	But in the two areas , two areas where peace can he won in the field of disarmament and in our representations abroad this country has been ill served . Disarmament planning is the most glaring omission in the field of national security and world peace of the last 8 years . [ Applause .	Nixon_November_3_1960	Kennedy_November_2_1960
0405	unemployment	attack	One will never learn from my opponent that employment declined less than seasonally last month and that unemployment went down more than seasonally . Unemployment dropped not only as to number but also as a percentage of the labor force . His pessimistic talk today recalls to my mind the situation in 1953 when the Eisenhower administration assumed responsibility for the Nation 's affairs .	And unemployment is not insignificant to the Democratic Party - which has always pursued a policy of full employment - which has never said that there  must be some unemployment  and which is going to see that there are jobs for all Americans in the sixties . In fact , unemployment is only insignificant to Mr. Nixon and a Republican Party which has opposed every Democratic effort to put men back to work in the past 8 years - which has complacently stood by while unemployment rose from less than 2 million in 1952 to 4 million today and while Michigan lost more than 100,000 jobs despite an expanding population . For I believe that the American people are going to reject a party which - again in Mr. Nixon 's words - believes that  unemployment is inevitable ,  a party which lacks faith in the capacity of a strong and growing America to provide jobs for all its people , a party which , in the most fundamental sense , is letting America run down because it is failing to build America up , a party whose candidate is all too ready to threaten war but is unwilling to build up the strength which is the only guarantee of peace , who is always willing to speak loudly , but is unwilling to be sure that America carries a big stick .

Mr. Nixon did not ignore party affiliations between elections , when he led the Republican opposition to increased minimum wages , medical care for the aged , aid to education , help for distressed areas , and all the rest and the American people are not going to ignore Mr. Nixon 's party affiliation next week . The third Nixon theme is an attack on the policies of the Democratic Party .	They do n't care , and I 'll prove it . We have a bill which does it the American way , not one that would have compulsory health insurance that would reduce the standard of medical care , that would compel millions of people who do n't want it and did n't need it to have it , but , one , a bill in which every American over 65 who wanted health insurance can get it , either private or Government , but in which no one in this country is compelled to have it against his will . That 's the American way of handling this problem .	Kennedy_October_30_1960	Nixon_October_29_1960
0407	minimum wage	attack	The principles for which Dwight Eisenhower and I have fought and will continue to fight are the ideals not only of Republicans but of Democrats as well . All through the campaign my opponent has been trumpeting the falsehood that I , in effect , feast on human misery - that I oppose minimum wage , help to distressed areas , social security , medical care for the aged , and all else that concerns the good of the American people . Last week Mr. Kennedy called me the leader of the social security wrecking crew - trying to secure votes from the aged by playing on their fears .	Mr. Nixon voted against it , every single time , and I voted for it . Minimum wage - I see some signs waved around by great supportcrs of Mr. Nixon . I want to ask them three questions .	Nixon_November_3_1960	Kennedy_October_31_1960
0408	medical care,health care	attack	Now , what does this mean ? This means that we do want progress in this country , and want it to increase , but , my friends , the way to get it is to recognize that the engine of progress in the United States is not the Federal Government , but 180 million free individual Americans inspired by Government . Our opponents say they want progress and they 'll produce it , but you know how they say they 're going to get it ? They 're going to set up a huge new Government program in everything , whether its medical care or schools or housing or anything else , turn it over to the Federal Government , and they say this proves they care more for progress , that they will produce more . But , my friends , the record shows they 're wrong , because those are the same policies we found under Mr. Truman .	Every administration and every 3 or 4 years , this country has to recognize that we must move ahead . So there is one set of opportunities which will be open to the next President and the next Congress , minimum wage of $ 1.25 an hour , medical care for the aged tied to social security , aid to education , stimulation of housing , urban renewal . These are all programs which have been part of our life for a great many years , really since Franklin Roosevelt 's first administration .	Nixon_October_15_1960	Kennedy_October_15_1960
0409	medical care,health care	no_relation	This is a contest between a party which says  No  to the next decade and a party which says  Yes  as it has in so many years of our history . As long as there are millions of Americans who live in substandard housing as long as there are millions of our older citizens who wait out their lives with an income of less than $ 20 a week , without hope of good housing or medical care in their old age , as long as there are children in this country who go to school on a part-time basis , with teachers inadequately compensated , as long as there is unfinished business in this country , so long is their need for the Democratic Party , and there is need for the Democratic Party today . [ Applause .	This need , still unmet , requires priority attention by the next Congress . The program must be a voluntary one , avoiding compulsory medical care as well as compulsory participation in medical care programs . It would support rather than discourage private medical insurance efforts .	Kennedy_September_15_1960	Nixon_September_14_1960
0411	medical care,health care	no_relation	That 's what the program will buy for you . A compulsory medical care program - and I will have more to say about that in a moment . A teachers ' program , an education program , which differs from ours in this fundamental : It would take our teachers and put them directly under the Federal Government as far as subsidization of their salaries is concerned , and the net result of that would give the inevitable power to the Federal Government to tell our teachers what to teach - and we do n't want that in Washington .	in the first place , we have our responsibilities toward our people in this country , toward the 15 million Americans over the age of 65 who live on an average social security check of less than $ 78 a month . And yet this administration has refused to provide medical care for the aged tied to social security in the same way as they opposed social security itself 25 years ago . But in this area , and in minimum wage and in housing and in social justice , we move in the tradition of Franklin Roosevelt .	Nixon_October_18_1960	Kennedy_October_17_1960
0412	disarmament	attack	I think that we have many arms in the arsenal , and one of course is that , and we should keep that second to none . Secondly , I hope that we can try to work out with our adversaries , the Communists , a realistic system with inspection for the lessening of arms tension , for the cessation of nuclear tests and for the beginning of disarmament , and lift that heavy burden from us all . Thirdly , I think that we should assist those countries to the south of us who are attempting to solve their staggering economic problems and help them join with us .	Why is it that you stand against the proposals for disarmament that are made by Mr. Khrushchev ? Why is it that we ca n't go more than halfway on these proposals and take some of them on faith ?  I want to tell you why we ca n't . Because if the United States ever enters into a disarmament agreement with the Soviet or with any other potential aggressor which they might break and which we would keep , that would increase the danger of war rather than reduce it and that we must never do .

Now , the last point that I make is one that I make particularly because I know of the great concern the people in these university communities have for the cause of disarmament . People have often spoken to me - my friends who are Quakers , as I am , have written to me - and they have said ,  Mr .	 Our chief negotiator . This administration is liable on the whole series of grounds , Latin America , Africa , Asia , outer space , and here in the field of disarmament , which involves the security and peace of every person in and out of the State of Wisconsin , the head of our mission should say ,  We have given it very little time and attention .

In other words , I do not like to see the United States offer assistance to Latin America as a result of difficulties in Cuba . I would like to see us offer the hand of friendship to Latin America because of a traditional conviction that the United States can not maintain its freedom unless Latin America is a strong and viable and growing hemisphere .	They feel we were correct , I think , the majority of them , in acting as we did with regard to the sugar , the taking away of special consideration that we had with regard to sugar . They thought that was justified in view of the Cuban Government 's expropriation of much of our property , but I think our present course in Cuba has not lost us friends in Latin America .

How much have they cost the taxpayer for the dams and highways that cost more now than they did when they should have been built ? How can you measure the cost of increased juvenile delinquency bred in the slums they refuse to clean up ? How can you measure the cost to their families of the medical care aged persons are denied ? How can you measure the cost every consumer bears in high interest rates - or the cost of an abandoned farms - or the cost of illness caused by polluted water ? How much more are emergency programs in foreign aid costing us because we did not long ago take the steps we should have taken before a crisis was reached in the Middle East , in Latin America or in Africa ? And how do you measure the cost to a country whose security is in danger of being nibbled away by brush-fire wars too limited to justify the use of the massive retaliation our defense budgets have forced us to rely upon ? I do not call that economy . The Republican Party is one of waste - the waste of our human resources and the waste of our natural resources .	Thomas Jefferson has often made the point that the greatest guarantee of freedom is to diffuse power and that we must not have concentration of power in an all-powerful Federal Government , and it is because we believe that any kind of program that would put immense power in the Federal Government over our school system is something that Americans should reject , not because of the amount of money that is being spent , but because this kind of power is something which , in the wrong hands , would be something that all Americans would be against . Let me give you one other example in the program of medical care for the aged . We all want better health care for our older citizens .	Kennedy_October_4_1960	Nixon_October_3_1960
0418	cuba	attack	These people will feel they have no chance , and then , of course , they will listen to Castros . So I would suggest that the United States try to develop again the spirit of the good neighbor policy of Franklin Roosevelt , that we regard this as the first line of defense , that we bring in students , that we broadcast in Spanish to Cuba and all of Latin America , that we tell our story , that we help them distribute their agricultural products and resources , and maintain their economy and provide a gradual increase in the standard of living for each person . This is the key to Latin America .	[ Cheers and applause . ] And then , three , we have the lesson in Cuba , here again the President , with great statesmanship , saying he will contain Mr. Castro ; we will contain him economically and politically , Senator Kennedy saying  No '  ; we 've got to go further , and then shooting from the hip , advocating direct Government intervention , in effect , and it was interpreted that way all over the free world , in the affairs of Cuba . What would that have done ? It would have decimated the people of that island .	Kennedy_November_7_1960	Nixon_November_5_1960
0419	minimum wage	no_relation	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .	They are equally entitled to share in economic progress . The fiscal burden of an inadequate minimum wage law lies upon the community , and thus upon every taxpayer .

Because we 're the strongest nation in the world , and the difference is : We do n't want to use our strength for anything except to keep the peace . We do n't want anything from anybody else , but remember this : The moment the men in the Kremlin ever have more strength than we have , the moment we ever enter into a disarmament agreement , which would not have ironclad inspection , in which they would gain strength against us , we find that the enemies of peace then , the men in the Kremlin , are in a position where they can do what they want , and that is : They would use their strength to start war . They would use it because their aim is to conquer the world .	We had no position and we adopted that of the British . Our negotiators had to leave Geneva during the Conference itself to come to Washington to find out what our position was , and again we failed to prepare for disarmament .

0426	medical care,health care	attack	The question was , Am I for the Forand bill ? I introduced a companion bill to the Forand bill in the U.S. Senate . The Forand bill , of course , puts medical care for the aged under the social security system . We tried to pass a bill comparable to that during the last session of the Congress .	I believe that the most effective method is through a program which will provide a choice whereby people who want to have the protection for catastrophic illnesses or , for that matter , for noncatastrophic illnesses , if they so desire , can have it , but where they are not forced to have it if they do not desire , and where they can choose getting that protection through government or through private plans , which they might choose , with some government assistance . And I would agree with Senator Kennedy , incidentally , to this extent : he indicated that this would be an issue in the campaign , I think it will be an issue in the campaign , and the question will not be one of ends , because both of us believe that there should he protection for our older citizens for medical care . The question will be one of means .	Kennedy_September_7_1960	Nixon_August_24_1960

0437	medical care,health care	no_relation	I 'm proud of that record , and we have a program that will produce greater progress and greater prosperity on those issues for America in the future , I can assure you . But may I say it would n't be enough to rest our case there because , you know , you can have the best jobs , the best social security , the best medical care that we can possibly imagine , and it is n't going to make any difference if we 're not around to enjoy it . And , so , I say peace without surrender , the extension of freedom , this is the great issue .	My answer to that is that it is extremely difficult , if not impossible , to put through any program , particularly if the program is controversial and new , if the opposing party uses all of the parliamentary devices that are available to Members of the House and Senate , and if we are opposed by the President of the United States . Now , in the case of medical care for the aged , as I said in my statement , being tied to social security , which I thought was extremely important , as you know in the Senate we secured the support of only one Republican , and we were informed by the minority leader , Mr. Dirksen , when the matter came to a vote , that if we passed social security , it would be vetoed by the President . In the case of the $ 1.25 minimum wage , which was my bill , which we did pass in the Senate by a vote of 2 to 1 , we failed in the conference with the House , after Mr. Dirksen , the minority leader , announced that the President of the United States would veto any bill that had $ 1.25 minimum wage .

0441	disarmament	support	People have often spoken to me - my friends who are Quakers , as I am , have written to me - and they have said ,  Mr . Nixon , why does n't the United States show a more flexible attitude ? Why do n't we take the first step toward disarmament ?  Let me tell you what we have done . We have not only taken one step ; we have not only taken two steps , but we have gone the second mile , the third mile , way down the line on disarmament .	Fourth , while we are working to dismantle the engines of destruction we must work out methods of protecting ourselves against the growing danger of accidental war , through sure methods of informing ourselves about suspicious events or accidental firings so that neither nation can make a mistake which will trigger nuclear destruction . Fifth - And most important , the fight for disarmament must command the personal attention and concern of the President of the United States . Our defense and six disarmament experts are concentrated in many important agencies of Government - in the State Department , the Defense Department , the AEC and others .

0442	disarmament	attack	Whenever that balance changes , whenever the Soviet Union gains strength as against our strength , war 's danger increases , because they are wanting to use their strength not as we are , for peace , but to conquer the world . So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war . That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests .	We did not come up with a single major new proposal in the field of arms control , and we cared so little about it that we regarded the entire effort as merely a part of our effort in psychological warfare . At the London Conference of 1957 , the first important disarmament Conference held in the fifties , and the one which came closest of any in reaching an agreement on disarmament , we sent a man who had not been active in the field , Harold Stassen , we sent him to a meeting without formulating an American position . Mr. Stassen was never able to get clear instructions at the meeting as to what our position was .	Nixon_October_27_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
0443	cuba	no_relation	We can not be committed by a party of the past . We can not wait for Mr. Khrushchev 's words , for the Communists are not satisfied with their gains of the last months , with their lead in missiles and space , and their foothold in Cuba , and half of Indochina , and their new influence in Laos and Africa and Asia . They will keep on driving and expanding and gaining without regard to all the kitchen debates and without regard to what goes on in the United Nations unless we have a President and a country in the 1960 's that acts first and acts fast .	And I am speaking now of the United Nations , of the Organization of American States - Oh , you know , a lot of people say to me sometimes ,  Why do we worry about these organizations like this ? We 're strong enough . Why do n't we move into the Congo as Khrushchev did , unilaterally ? Why do n't we go into Cuba unilaterally , on our own , instead of working through all the rest of the American States as we have ?  And the answer is this : The United States can not and must not do this because if we are going to have real peace and real security in the world , we must have other free nations and other peace-loving nations working with us , rather than against us . And we must set an ideal - an ideal which they will follow - an ideal that we will work with these organizations to see that things that otherwise would be settled on the battlefield , are settled at the conference table .

The 1960 bill supported by my opponent was so bad , for example , that relatively little help would have gone to the areas of chronic unemployment really needing it . This politically inspired , opportunistic bill would have frittered away much of its assistance on places bearing no resemblance to our few truly distressed areas .	He can not run on a platform setting one State against another . I want full employment in California and New York and across the Nation ; it is Mr. Nixon who calls unemployment inevitable .

But anyone who believes as I do that this country will never be strong in the world , that we will never be successful in turning Mr. Khrushchev back , we will never be successful in expanding freedom around the world unless we have in this country a strong and vital and progressive society , and that is what we are committed to , that is what we are committed to , and I believe the American people on November 8 , faced with a choice of a leadership that looks to the past and the present , and recognizing that this country , the only hope of freedom that there is , we are the only sentinel at the gate , and if we do n't move ahead , if we do n't provide employment for our people , if we do n't use our facilities to the fullest , if we do n't educate our children and provide under social security medical care for our aged and jobs for those in between , then the United States , instead of being the leader of the free world , will cease to count as the only hope of freedom .

What has been the result ? Today , in six key areas around the world , we are reacting too late to a cold war crisis where the cause of freedom is in serious trouble ; in Cuba , where Communists openly plot the disruption of hemispheric security - in Ghana , whose President was assailed by Mr. Herter last week as  very definitely leaning toward the Soviet bloc  - in Japan , where the anti-American demonstrations have already been mentioned - in the area once known as Indochina , where the tiny nation of Laos is struggling to keep its head above a Communist tide - in Poland , where the once hopeful cracks in the Iron Curtain seem to be gradually disappearing - and in India , where the one nation capable of surpassing China for the economic leadership of the Asian continent is meeting one setback after another . These six areas are far apart in their geography , their history , their devotion to freedom and the kind of threat their situations now pose .	I realize that line is subject to criticism , because we have a very difficult situation ; but to those who do criticize what we are doing my answer , of course , is : What is the alternative ? There are those who say ,  Why do n't we send Marines to Cuba ?  We could do it and we could give it to Mr. Castro in 24 hours , but getting rid of Castro in Cuba would not get rid of Castroism in Cuba or in Latin America and it would set in motion , in my opinion , a chain reaction of opposition to the United States through the other Latin American countries , which could be very , very detrimental to our foreign policy . That 's why I think the United States , with its great power , has to continue to treat Cuba , as it has , with consideration , always patient , working with our other friends in Latin America , to be sure that they will support our position toward Castro and toward his close association with communism in Cuba . I would add one other thing : I think that Mr. Castro 's very close identification with Mr. Khrushchev at the U.N. will not help him in Cuba .	Kennedy_September_29_1960	Nixon_September_21_1960

0455	disarmament	attack	And you ask about prestige . What do our opponents think ? Do they think that Mr. Khrushchev gains prestige for the Communists when he takes off his shoe at the United Nations and pounds the table with it ? I say no. I say that President Eisenhower gained prestige for America when with great dignity and great responsibility , he stood for peace , for disarmament , for all the things that Americans believe in. No , my friends , the real test of prestige , if our prestige was low , I can assure you , would occur in the United Nations , and there what do we find ? In every instance where we 've had a test vote - and listen to this - in the last 7 years , with the Soviet Union on one side and the United States on the other , we have won ; and in the vote on the Congo we won , 70 to nothing . My friends , that 's a pretty good score in football .	But no matter how difficult the problems are , how discouraging the obstacles , how uncertain the prospect for agreement , we must , nevertheless , begin a determined , large-scale effort to prepare ourselves for disarmament - to formulate constructive and realistic proposals which have a chance of success . For the hopes of all mankind rest on successful disarmament . And if we let the nations of Africa and Asia and Latin America feel that the United States is the real obstacle to disarmament , that we are not sincere in our desire for peace - if we continue to let the Soviet Union seize the offensive in disarmament negotiations - then these emerging areas of the world may well turn away from America and the free world , and begin to look to the Communist bloc for leadership in the fight for peace .

0456	disarmament	no_relation	I want to make it clear that I come to this section of Wisconsin to ask your support in this campaign with the full realization that the responsibility and burdens of the Presidency will be greater than they have ever been in the past . The whole spread of atomic weapons , the whole subject of disarmament , the whole crisis over Berlin which will hit this country and Western Germany hard next winter and next spring , the problems in the Far East , the maintenance of freedom in Latin America and Africa and Asia , the maintenance of full employment here in this section of Wisconsin , which depends on the paper industry , the maintenance of full employment in Pennsylvania which depends on an outgoing steel industry , the maintenance of full employment in West Virginia and Kentucky , which depend on coal - all these burdens will fall upon the desk of the next President of the United States . The tremendous revolution in agriculture , which has provided a great increase in the production of food and a sharp decrease in farm income - all these will come to rest upon the desk of the next President of the United States .	We have to have the power because we are friends of peace . As long as America is the strongest nation in the world , the world need not fear that there will be war , because we will use our strength to keep peace , and I think that all of you , including those who are as dedicated to peace as I am , will say that we want the next President of the United States always to go the extra mile , as President Eisenhower has , to negotiate with Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else for disarmament . We want to go the extra mile to strengthen the United Nations and the instruments of peace , but under no circumstances do we want the next President to be a man who will be fooled , who will make concessions to them without getting concessions in return , and , above all , we do not want the next President to be one who will reduce the strength of America unless we 're absolutely sure that the enemies of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time .

0457	disarmament	no_relation	In short , no problem is more vital or more urgent in the struggle for peace than the problem of effective arms control . Yet , in the past 80 years , this problem has been virtually ignored ; we have had no real disarmament policy . And we have completely failed to provide the effort and the leadership which the pursuit of disarmament demands .	We know what peace demands . We will always go the extra mile to strengthen peace , the extra mile to work for disarmament , the extra mile to reduce tensions , but we will always remember that the man we are dealing with and his colleagues are ruthless , fanatical aggressors and that they do not follow the rules of the game that we would like them to follow , and that we must treat them the way they are , and this means that we must never make a concession without being sure that we 're getting one in return , that we must never agree , for example , to disarmament unless we can be sure that they , too , are disarming . Why is this necessary for peace ? Because , as I said at my last stop , we 've got to remember that as long as the United States maintains its present position of being stronger than anyone who threatens the peace of the world we can be the guardians of peace ; but the moment that somebody or some nation that does not want peace - in other words , that would use war as an instrument of conquest - is stronger than we are , or thinks they are , then peace is no longer safe .

0458	disarmament	support	But I can not believe that there is one person in this State or Nation who would not like to see the arms race ended - the threat of war recede - and the billions now spent on weapons of destruction turned to schools and hospitals and homes and dams . With careful planning for reconversion , this State would enjoy a greater boom under disarmament than it ever enjoyed in the cold war . For peace is our deepest aspiration .	[ Applause . ] And the reason that we insist that disarmament must not be just a fine slogan but that it must be honest and that there must be an agreement which will see that both sides keep it is not because we do not want disarmament but because we do want disarmament . We want the fact of disarmament rather than the fiction of it which is what the Soviets up to this time have been offering , since they have not offered inspection along with it .

0459	unemployment	no_relation	Senator John F. Kennedy today declared that-- the midyear budget report shows our fiscal stake in full employment . Rising unemployment and slack business conditions will cause a loss of at least $ 2 billion in anticipated revenue-- Kennedy said . The failure of corporate profits to rise and the consequent loss of expected corporate tax collections has caused a substantial change in the budget picture .	And , so I want to make clear where we do stand . I favor programs , programs that are constructive , programs that will work , programs that will produce progress ; more schools , a breakthrough in science , a breakthrough in medical care and medical research , progress in terms of better jobs for the American people , raising the minimum standards as far as our minimum wage , and our unemployment coverage is concerned . All of these things I stand for , but I want to make one thing clear : As far as the cost of my programs are concerned , they are billions less than what my opponent 's would cost .

0460	cuba	no_relation	I say in that connection that with all the criticism of President Eisenhower 's administration , they ca n't take away the solid fact that under his leadership we got the United States out of one war ; we 've kept her out of other wars , and we do have peace without surrender today . Yes , there are problems , problems like the one in Cuba that my opponent is discussing tonight without offering any solution for , and , incidentally , may I say , looking at that problem , I will have more to say about that at a later time , and he had better look to the record of his administration before he starts criticizing ours in that field . He talks about dictators , and I can only say that the number of dictators we inherited from the Truman administration is far greater than the number we have today in Latin America , and that 's something he must remember .	We stepped up a constant stream of weapons and munitions to Batista - justified in the name of hemispheric defense , when , in fact , their only real use was to crush the dictator 's opposition , and even when the Cuban civil war was raging - until March of 1958 - the administration continued to send arms to Batista which were turned against the rebels - increasing anti-American feeling and helping to strengthen the influence of the Communists . For example , in Santa Clara , Cuba , today there is an exhibit commemorating the devastation of that city by Batista 's planes in December of 1958 . The star item in that exhibit is a collection of bomb fragments inscribed with a handshake and the words :  Mutual Defense - made in U.S.A. Even when our Government had finally stopped sending arms , our military missions stayed to train Batista 's soldiers for the fight against the revolution - refusing to leave until Castro 's forces were actually in the streets of Havana .

0461	unemployment	attack	We are going to have to build a better life for our people . As long as there are 15 million American homes which are substandard , as long as there are millions of Americans who are not even paid a dollar an hour , as long as there are hundreds of thousands of Americans out of work , living on an average unemployment compensation check of $ 31 a week - what do they do when they go out of a job ? Where do they go to work ? How do they keep their families ? How do they pay their rent ? These are the problems that disturb America . How do we maintain our position in the world ? How do we provide fairness and equality of opportunity for all Americans ? I think that on Tuesday my job and responsibility and that of Mr. Nixon 's is over .	Promises for what ? Promises that would go back . Promises that would restore in this country policies that reduced the value of our dollars ; promises that would bring back in this country policies which discouraged business investment , policies which resulted in unemployment , policies which stagnated the American economy . I just want to say in that connection that , as you consider the promises that have been made in this campaign , we all must remember that we pay for them , and as far as my opponent is concerned all that he offers is - what ? He offers promises ; promises that would add $ 15 billion a year to our Federal spending in Washington .	Kennedy_November_4_1960	Nixon_November_1_1960
0463	medical care,health care	no_relation	Therefore , we will build a mobile retaliatory force incapable of destruction by surprise attack , and modernize and strengthen our conventional forces so as to deter limited war . Second , we will act to strengthen America here at home , by working to reverse the current decline in our rate of economic growth and rate of employment , by meeting the needs of our people for medical care , for education , for housing and all the rest , and by assuring every American , of every race and creed equal opportunity in all the activities of our national life . In this way we can convince the people of the developing nations that the road to progress is freedom 's road - that democracy , not communism , offers the brightest hope for their future .	I have made another proposal in the health area which I regard as very significant . Health insurance for citizens of all ages has made a major contribution to improve the quality of medical care . In order to accelerate the purchase of health insurance for catastrophic illnesses , I believe that we should be permitted to deduct for income-tax purposes the cost of premiums .

0464	disarmament	no_relation	 Let me tell you about disarmament . When people say ,  I 'm for disarmament ,  and when some people write to me and say  Why , when Mr. Khrushchev comes over and says he 's for total disarmament - why do we have to insist on inspection ? Why ,  they say ,  could n't we just do it ? Would n't that be real leadership in the world ? Would n't that be bold and imaginative ?  Yes , it would ; but do you know what would happen ? The moment the United States ever enters into an agreement for disarmament , which would result in increasing his strength as against ours , we do n't help the cause of peace . We hurt it , because - why is America the guardian of peace today ? Because we 're the strongest nation in the world , and the difference is : We do n't want to use our strength for anything except to keep the peace .	He prepared a report . The report was thrown aside , and this time a New York lawyer without any experience in the field of disarmament became head of our mission . We had no position and we adopted that of the British .	Nixon_October_25_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
0467	disarmament	attack	But he has been standing for the right . He has been standing for peace , for real disarmament , for helping our friends abroad . All these things he has been standing for .	There is no sense having a meeting unless there is an atmosphere before the meeting which leads you to hope that there will be some success . On the issues on which we are divided with the Soviet Union , disarmament and Berlin , which are the two chief ones at the present time , there is no indication that there is a common meeting ground . Therefore , just to meet , just to sit down , just to spend an hour , unless there is some basis for hope , particularly as Khrushchev is being extremely belligerent now , I thought the President showed good judgment .	Nixon_October_6_1960	Kennedy_October_4_1960
0468	disarmament	no_relation	We will never be belligerent . We 're always going to be willing to go the extra mile to negotiate disarmament or anything , but we 're never going to fall into the fatal error of what has got us in war in the past and that is let dictators think that we will not react . So , this is the way to peace , and I want you to know that we will have no greater obligation than to keep the peace for ourselves , for our children , and also to see to it that our children have an opportunity to grow up and have a better life even than we 've had .	And by that time our chief negotiator had been repudiated by the administration , and publicly demoted from the White House staff . At the next important disarmament conference , the 1958 Geneva Conference on surprise attack , we were represented by a businessman who had been out of Government for 5 years , and who had assumed his duties only 5 weeks before the conference met . Almost up to the opening day of the meeting , we had prepared no position , conducted no special research , formulated no realistic or constructive proposals .

Are the people of Illinois and the people of this city and the people of this district to have a change to determine what kind of government they want here in this State and across the country ? Do you feel that everything that has to be done to provide better working conditions for our people and better housing , and medical care for the aged , which affects us all , because we all have someone in our family that needs assistance - and under the bill which the Congress passed and which was signed by the administration , before anyone can get medical aid , they have to sign a petition that they are indigent , that they are broke , that they have expended their money , that they are paupers . I believe in medical care for the aged , nursing care , all tied to social security , which has served our people so well for 25 years .	Physicians and scientists in fields closely allied to medicine have told me how they are already probing below the level of the body 's cells and have begun to explore the molecules in the cells - the fundamental area where both normality and disease are controlled . We are , therefore , now in a position to further this mounting scientific attack upon disease and health problems by broad general programs directed toward the support of research , training of medical , dental , and other health manpower , and expansion of health care facilities .

As a result of this failure we have been steadily unprepared on disarmament .	I see him , ruthless , tough , completely a man dedicated to one purpose only - the evil purpose of conquering the world , and this is what I know . If America ever makes the mistake of entering into a disarmament agreement , which he does not also keep with inspection , it will increase the danger of war rather than reduce it , and I 'll tell you why : We can not leave to a man who is the enemy of peace power to start a war and destroy the world .

You have been most kind to do so , and before I conclude - and I have only 7 minutes left out of the 40 minutes , Mr. Hayes , before I conclude - I want to turn to the most important issue of all , and now you people are going to think I really have a hole in my head . How can anything be more important than our jobs , our schools , our medical care and the answer is : being around to enjoy it . What is more important , and the major test , that you should apply in electing the next President of the United States is which of the two men can best lead the free world and keep the peace without surrender for America and for the free people throughout the world .

But let us always remember that Mr. Khrushchev is not going to be impressed by mere words .	It 's a typically specious and frivolous maneuver . We have made a good-faith effort to advance the - advance toward disarmament - and make some progress by having a meeting of the Disarmament Commission . Now , when they make a proposal like this , it 's a cynical attempt to prevent progress , that 's what it is it shows that they do n't really want disarmament .

Franklin Roosevelt impressed them not so much because he poured out American money , but because he was a moving , compassionate figure , moving his own society at home , identifying himself with people around the world who also wish to live in the sun .	They can say we ca n't object to the Soviet Union moving into Cuba under the Monroe Doctrine - we could at the present time - if the United States is attempting to intervene and move into the internal affairs of Cuba .

I have proposed in the Congress the establishment of a National Peace Agency - an Arms Control Research Institute - and the next President of the United States must take this step to pave the way for peace .

The misstatement : In the second debate Senator Kennedy said : The Republicans in recent years , not only in the last 25 years , but in the last 8 years , have opposed * * * minimum wage * * The facts : Senator Kennedy is saying that Republicans who opposed his particular bill are against minimum wage . The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve . In 1960 , this administration sought to extend minimum wage coverage to 3.1 million additional workers and indicated support of an increase in the minimum wage to $ 1.15 per hour .

As a matter of fact , this talk about the fact that Cuba is lost and that Ghana is lost , and Guinea is lost , incidentally - and they have also claimed that - is irresponsible in the extreme . Cuba is not lost . The fact that Castro , of course , is following a pro-Communist line at the present time causes us great concern , but there are plenty of things that we can do and are doing , and we 're taking some very firm steps , as you know , to quarantine Castro in that area .

0497	medical care,health care	no_relation	The overall increase in the cost of living has been only about 22 percent . For medical care it has been 35 percent , for rent 30 percent , for the general costs , particularly in the heavy industries , it has gone up more than 30 percent . This is a serious problem , not only to our own people who are adversely affected by a steady increase in their cost of living , but it is also a serious problem in our attempts to compete in other markets , in automobiles , in steel , in heavy construction .	I feel very strongly on this . As a matter of fact , I introduced one of the first bills providing that all of our older people and others would be able to obtain medical care insurance when I was a Congressman back in the year 1948 . One of the reasons I feel strongly about it is that I have seen what it means for our older citizens , when , after having saved their money , they have retired and are living on a very small income , to have tremendous medical expenses hit them .

0500	medical care,health care	attack	As this campaign enters its final week , the Republicans are stepping up their efforts to convince the voters to forget party labels , party records , and party differences . The American voter , however , will have no trouble in making a clear choice if he keeps in mind at least six basic areas of disagreement between Mr. Nixon and myself : ( 1 ) Medical care for the aged : The Republican plan permits only a handfuT of retired workers to receive public assistance for medical care if they are willing to surrender their dignity by taking a  pauper 's oath .  The Democratic plan would permit this cost to be covered under our social security system , so that all workers may set aside a few cents every day during their working years to help pay their medical bills when their earning power is gone .	Vocational training and other educational programs are prime cases in point , where we can buy invaluable lead-time against the problems of the aged by starting with persons of middle age . One of the most important preventives of all would be to accelerate the use of private medical care insurance programs which would enable people of working age to take adequate action to safeguard their health . I think we should give immediate consideration to allowing tax deductions for the cost of health insurance , designed to protect them against catastrophic illnesses that place crippling burdens on our families .

0502	unemployment	no_relation	And by electing Paul Bagwell Governor of Michigan - and I say this to this national audience - I think that you are going to find that Michigan then will get its right share - rightful share of the new business which should come to Michigan with all of its skilled employees . As far as the interim period is concerned , of course we have got - we must handle our unemployment insurance in a way that it will adequately cover all of those who are unemployed , and we must extend the system - and I have advocated this - extend the system to fill some of the loopholes that presently exist . But the long-range solution is to get more business into Michigan so that you can provide the jobs .	[ Applause . ] On television this afternoon he repeated one of the oldest , tiredest stories of the Republicans , that $ 1.25 minimum wage would cause massive unemployment .

Even when our Government had finally stopped sending arms , our military missions stayed to train Batista 's soldiers for the fight against the revolution - refusing to leave until Castro 's forces were actually in the streets of Havana . Finally , while we were allowing Batista to place us on the side of tyranny , we did nothing to persuade the people of Cuba and Latin America that we wanted to be on the side of freedom . In 1953 we eliminated all regular Spanish language broadcasts of the Voice of America .	I think I should prefer to answer it in this way , the only responsible way . As President Eisenhower has indicated time and time again , the United States can not tolerate Russian influence or a Russian-dominated government in Cuba or in the Americas . Now the President has made that clear .	Kennedy_October_6_1960	Nixon_October_2_1960

Promises that would restore in this country policies that reduced the value of our dollars ; promises that would bring back in this country policies which discouraged business investment , policies which resulted in unemployment , policies which stagnated the American economy . I just want to say in that connection that , as you consider the promises that have been made in this campaign , we all must remember that we pay for them , and as far as my opponent is concerned all that he offers is - what ? He offers promises ; promises that would add $ 15 billion a year to our Federal spending in Washington .	Social security ? They voted against it . Minimum wage ? Unemployment compensation ? Housing ?

0507	disarmament	attack	And you ask about prestige . What do our opponents think ? Do they think that Mr. Khrushchev gains prestige for the Communists when he takes off his shoe at the United Nations and pounds the table with it ? I say no. I say that President Eisenhower gained prestige for America when with great dignity and great responsibility , he stood for peace , for disarmament , for all the things that Americans believe in. No , my friends , the real test of prestige , if our prestige was low , I can assure you , would occur in the United Nations , and there what do we find ? In every instance where we 've had a test vote - and listen to this - in the last 7 years , with the Soviet Union on one side and the United States on the other , we have won ; and in the vote on the Congo we won , 70 to nothing . My friends , that 's a pretty good score in football .	This administration , a year ago , in order to get a position on disarmament , appointed a lawyer from my own State of Massachusetts , Mr. Coolidge , who had had no previous experience in the field . After 3 months , his report was dismissed and so was he , and a New York lawyer , after 5 weeks of preparation , was sent to head up our mission to the Disarmament Conference . One hundred people working on one of the most important , involved , specialized fields the subject of disarmament , nuclear control .	Nixon_October_26_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
0508	disarmament	no_relation	Whenever that balance changes , whenever the Soviet Union gains strength as against our strength , war 's danger increases , because they are wanting to use their strength not as we are , for peace , but to conquer the world . So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war . That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests .	In a message to Congress on January 7 , 1941 , President Roosevelt translated freedom from fear to mean  a worldwide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor anywhere in the world .  In short , freedom from fear was freedom from war - the pursuit of that freedom was the pursuit of peace - the method of achieving that freedom was the method of disarmament . Today , 20 years later , we are still far from Franklin Roosevelt 's goal .	Nixon_October_27_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
0509	medical care,health care	no_relation	Let me make it very clear what I would like this country to be at the end of the next 4 years or 8 years . I would like it to be said that in our administration , if we are successful , in the next 4 or 8 years , that our country moved here at home , it began to solve the problems that face our people , it put special emphasis on education , because no free society can survive without the best educational system in the world , it took care of our children and gave attention to the medical care for the aged . So that our older citizens could live out their lives in some security .	All these things they want . But , you know , my friends , we can have all these things , the best jobs in the world , the best medical care and the best schools , and it is n't going to make any difference if we 're not around to enjoy them . So , the first responsibility of a President of the United States , I say , is to provide the leadership that will keep America at peace and will extend freedom throughout the world .

0511	minimum wage	attack	They talked . But what did they produce ? They promised a 25-percent minimum wage increase in place of the program that President Eisenhower asked for and that could have been passed and should have been passed . What did the workers get ? Nothing at all .	The second bill that was up and which is an issue in this campaign was a bill to provide $ 1.25 minimum wage . Four-fifths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives , including the Congressman of this district , who is chairman of the congressional committee for all Republicans , voted against the $ 1.25 minimum wage for a 40-hour week , not for a business which is only ten , fifteen , or twenty-five thousand dollars a year , but for a business which makes more than $ 1 million a year , we wanted to pay them $ 1.25 by 1962 , not this year , but 1962 , and to pay those that were not covered by 1964 $ 1.25 , and four-fifths of the Republicans voted against it . I think these issues are important , not because the minimum wage is maybe the most important issue in the United States today , and not because medical care for the aged itself may be the most important issue , and not because aid to education itself may be the most important issue .

Unfortunately , a life of health , dignity , and independence in retirement has not been realized by millions of America 's senior citizens . The pioneering , exhaustive studies of the Senate Subcommittee on Problems of the Aged and Aging , led by Senator McNamara of Michigan and Senator Kennedy , provide conclusive statistical and human evidence that at least half of those over 65 - 8 million older Americans : have income inadequate for good nutrition and ordinary living ; have serious health problems and even more serious problems of paying for medical care . In addition , too many of the aged and aging : face discrimination in eniployment because of age ; have unsuitable , often unbearable , housing conditions ; have little recreation , too often resulting in isolation and mental disturbance .

If America ever makes the mistake of entering into a disarmament agreement , which he does not also keep with inspection , it will increase the danger of war rather than reduce it , and I 'll tell you why : We can not leave to a man who is the enemy of peace power to start a war and destroy the world . We have to have the power because we are friends of peace .	He criticized administration farm vetoes . He stressed , and I quote him ,  The necessity for the restoration of cordial relations with Latin America  and he called for more effective action against disarmament .

Last night , in our debate , Mr. Nixon was asked to give his program for economic growth - what he intended to do to put idle plants and idle men back to work - to move America toward new heights of production and strength - to provide new jobs for an expanding population . But Mr. Nixon had no new program , no new approach ; just the same old tired policies which have resulted in a doubling of unemployment and in a slowing down of our growth until , today , we are growing more slowly than every other industrial nation in the world - policies which have resulted in a steel industry operating at only 50 percent of capacity - an automobile industry which has laid off thousands of men - and a State of Michigan where more than 200,000 men are unemployed and which has never emerged from the Republican recession of 1958 . But the Democratic Party does have a program - a program which will reverse the downward trend of the past 8 years - which will put men back to work and move America toward new heights of productivity and abundance - which will build the stronger America on which the cause of freedom depends .

But any citizen of this community and any citizen of Indiana who believes that the balance of power in the world is not moving in our direction , who is concerned about the rise of Castro in Cuba , and the spread of his power through all of Latin America , who is concerned that the nations of Africa are not following our road but one of nentrality and one of increasing friendship with the Communists , who believes that the economy of this country is moving at a slow rate , who sees that we are only using 50 percent of our steel capacity , only 50 percent - last week the Soviet Union outproduced us in steel , though they have one-half of the potential we do , because we are only using 54 percent of our capacity .

If you raise the minimum wage , in my opinion - and all the experts confirm this that I have talked to in the Government - above $ 1.15 , it would mean unemployment ; unemployment , because there are many industries that could not pay more than $ 1.15 without cutting down their work force ; $ 1.15 can be absorbed , and then at a later time we could move to $ 1.25 as the economy moves up .

Five times they have ignored the President 's recommendations and , instead , they have passed two pork-barrel bills of their own , each in an election year , 1958 and 1960 , and each so full of politics they were obviously nothing but veto-bait .

I believe the next President of the United States should sign the following bills , and if I am elected I will do so : 1. The area distress bill , a bill which put the credit and power and vigor of the economy of the Federal Government in those areas where unemployment is higher than 7 or 8 percent for a long period of time . In other words , the Federal Government will loan its credit to businesses that wish to come to areas such as this , will provide vocational retraining for older workers , provide supplemental unemployment compensation benefits for those who are out of work for a long time , will aid in cleansing the rivers , will aid in trying to bring new industry into this area .

If your mining areas are depressed - it is because mining areas all over the Nation are depressed - and our vital steel industry is being allowed to operate at barely 50 percent of capacity .

0532	medical care,health care	attack	The Republican leadership of the Senate knows full well that under the parliamentary situation of these final crowded weeks - and in the political atmosphere of rancor that developed - no significant civil rights measure could have passed . This same political atmosphere has also prevented action on a farm bill and on adequate minimum wage , housing , health care for the aged , and education bills . But progressive legislation has not been the aim of the Republican leadership .	I believe that the most effective method is through a program which will provide a choice whereby people who want to have the protection for catastrophic illnesses or , for that matter , for noncatastrophic illnesses , if they so desire , can have it , but where they are not forced to have it if they do not desire , and where they can choose getting that protection through government or through private plans , which they might choose , with some government assistance . And I would agree with Senator Kennedy , incidentally , to this extent : he indicated that this would be an issue in the campaign , I think it will be an issue in the campaign , and the question will not be one of ends , because both of us believe that there should he protection for our older citizens for medical care . The question will be one of means .	Kennedy_September_1_1960	Nixon_August_24_1960
0533	minimum wage	attack	Meanwhile , the contradictory statements of Senator Kennedy still leave him opposed to this position . The misstatement : In the second debate Senator Kennedy said : The Republicans in recent years , not only in the last 25 years , but in the last 8 years , have opposed * * * minimum wage * * The facts : Senator Kennedy is saying that Republicans who opposed his particular bill are against minimum wage . The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve .	[ Applause . ] Mr. Nixon leads a party which in 1935 voted 99 percent against the 25-cent minimum wage . And Mr. Nixon last week said $ 1.25 minimum wage is inflationary .

0534	disarmament	attack	We have not only taken one step ; we have not only taken two steps , but we have gone the second mile , the third mile , way down the line on disarmament . The point is : the Soviet Union is blocking the road to disarmament , blocking the road to stopping tests . Why ? Because they want a closed society and they want no inspection .	A recent independent survey concludes , and I quote it accurately ,  The only continuous features of our efforts in the disarmament field have been a lack of continuity in top personnel and a paucity of planning and research effort .  As a result , we have been unprepared at every disarmament conference that we have attended . At a time when our relative military strength was at its height , in the mid fifties , at a time when we had the best chance to reach an agreement on control of arms , there was not a single top person in the entire Government working on this subject .

0536	medical care,health care	no_relation	To meet this distress , the Democrats proposed that the medical expenses of retired Americans be financed through the social security system . But Mr. Nixon and the Republicans opposed medical care for the aged and they managed to defeat it in the Congress . A national magazine reported that when the Senate rollcall killing medical care for older citizens was announced , the Vice President smiled .	We just want to keep it as it is . We do n't care about medical care for the aged . He says , as far as we are concerned , we have no programs , nothing to offer , except standing where we are .

0537	medical care,health care	no_relation	This program later became law . The Republican administration recommended and supported a new medical care program for dependents of members of the armed services . Under a Republican administration , a sound health program for American Indians was initiated .	Let me say , briefly , I believe there are two points . First , those of you who are active in labor , those of you who lead organized labor movements , are concerned about the welfare of your people and concerned about the welfare of the general public , and you know very well , perhaps better than anyone , that this country still has unfinished business , that we have to maintain full employment , that we have to advance the standards of living of our people , of better housing , of better minimum wage , of medical care for the aged . Franklin Roosevelt could put forward a minimum wage of 25 cents an hour in 1935 , but that does not mean the job was finished .	Nixon_October_19_1960	Kennedy_October_19_1960

Do you know that Mr. Nixon leads a party which in the midthirties voted 90 percent against social security and voted 98 percent this summer against the medical care for the aged tied to social security . And now he calls all of these programs as progress .	They would risk the very recession that Senator Kennedy has so loosely and in a very demagogic way predicted . So I say to you that there is a way to progress , a way in which we can have better education without having Federal control of our education ; in which we can have better housing ; in which we can have improved medical care and medical care and insurance for our older people without socializing the medical institutions in this country , without compelling people to have health insurance unless they want it and giving them a choice , which is the American way of doing it ; a program in which we can have progress in civil rights , which will move forward from the area in which we are presently finding ourselves . All these things we can have , my friends , and , in addition , we can have progress which will create more jobs for more Americans in this great period of the sixties which we are now entering .

And we can not avoid the menace of a Communist base on Cuba , only 90 miles from our shores , merely by wishing it had not happened , though I wish it had not . I wish this administration had been as alert to that as they now say they were .	In every one of these three instances , do you see what would have happened if he had been President ? In Quemoy and Matsu , it might have meant war or it might have meant surrender . In Cuba , it might have meant war , by inviting the Communists in - civil war , which we could n't stay out of . And in Paris - the U-2 flights - it would have meant certainly surrender of principle , and it would have encouraged Mr. Khrushchev to beat him to a pulp , because that 's the only thing he understands .

We provide more benefits , and I 'm particularly glad to get this question because there is no more vicious statement that 's been made in this campaign by Senator Kennedy and some of his colleagues than that we oppose medical care for the aged . It is they who have an inadequate program .	Therefore , we will build a mobile retaliatory force incapable of destruction by surprise attack , and modernize and strengthen our conventional forces so as to deter limited war . Second , we will act to strengthen America here at home , by working to reverse the current decline in our rate of economic growth and rate of employment , by meeting the needs of our people for medical care , for education , for housing and all the rest , and by assuring every American , of every race and creed equal opportunity in all the activities of our national life .

Rather , I believe they will elect a candidate whose own philosophy and that of his party - the Democratic Party - has been consistent in the people 's interest at home and abroad . Mr. Nixon can call it practical progressivism or economic conservatism , but the label does not hide the package - which has been Mr. Nixon 's and the Republican Party 's constant opposition to meeting the needs of our people , opposition to $ 1.25 minimum wage , opposition to aid to education , opposition to medical care for the aged under social security , opposition to decent housing , opposition to adequate aid to the Nation 's depressed areas . Mr. Nixon can apply any label be wants to this record , but the record speaks far more eloquently than his changing definitions , tailored to suit the needs of his audiences , one label for the South , another for the North , another for the West , and still another for the East .

0550	cuba	attack	You have developed the technique of having your writers rewrite my statements , using those rewritten statements and attacking me for things I have never said or advocated . This is certainly the record with regard to the speeches you have been making in the past 45 hours on Cuba . I have never advocated and I do not now advocate intervention in Cuba in violation of our treaty obligations and in fact stated in Johnstown , Pa .	It 's been done , incidentally , over the objection of some well-intentioned , but hopelessly naive Castro apologists within the United States - and all that I can say with regard to Senator Kennedy 's position is that he apparently is attempting to obscure his association with the views of this pro-Castro group as indicated in the book that I mentioned a moment ago or he must have thought now that there would be political advantage in taking a stronger position than I have taken , a radical position , instead of the strong and sound position that the administration has taken . And , so , what does he suggest ? He comes up , as I pointed up , with the fantastic recommendation that the U.S. Government shall directly aid the anti-Castro forces both in and out of Cuba . Now , every freedom-loving person in the United States - let 's make it clear - is in sympathy with the democratic anti-Castro forces in Cuba and outside Cuba .	Kennedy_October_23_1960	Nixon_October_22_1960
0552	cuba	attack	I was in Cuba in 1957 and the American Ambassador informed me that the American Ambassador was the second most influential man in Cuba . There is not any doubt we had great influence in Cuba , and I think it is unfortunate that we did not use that influence more vigorously to persuade Mr. Batista to hold free , open elections , so that the people of Cuba could have made the choice , rather than holding onto his power and finally driven out by Castro at the point of a gun . Mr. Castro is now a Communist .	Now , before we go into this question , many people will say ,  But , Mr. Nixon , are you for Castro ? Do n't you think we ought to support the people that are against him ?  The question is not whether you 're for or against Castro . The question is : What do you do ? What can you properly do ? What can the great United States of America legally and properly do to help the people of Cuba get the kind of government they deserve ? And this is n't easy . It is n't the easy shooting-from-the-hip way that Senator Kennedy has suggested .	Kennedy_October_23_1960	Nixon_October_22_1960
0553	cuba	no_relation	These people will feel they have no chance , and then , of course , they will listen to Castros . So I would suggest that the United States try to develop again the spirit of the good neighbor policy of Franklin Roosevelt , that we regard this as the first line of defense , that we bring in students , that we broadcast in Spanish to Cuba and all of Latin America , that we tell our story , that we help them distribute their agricultural products and resources , and maintain their economy and provide a gradual increase in the standard of living for each person . This is the key to Latin America .	And what did my opponent say ? Oh , he said , it is n't enough . He said the American Government should give support to the forces inside and outside of Cuba that were against Castro . That sounded good , did n't it ? But , you know what it meant ? That would have violated the treaties we had with all the Latin American States .	Kennedy_November_7_1960	Nixon_November_5_1960
0554	cuba	no_relation	I believe this matter is so fundamental to decency in world affairs that until Red China has proved her adherence to these standards by her deeds and not just by her words , the next President should consider a veto , which we have never used , to be fully justified by the United States in the National Security Council - a veto of any effort to admit a nation that does not comply , as Red China does not comply . And now I want to turn to one other subject at hand , much closer , the problem of Cuba , a very difficult problem . People have often said ,  Mr .

Secondly , in the case of Cuba , I think the basic error was made in the last stage of Batista , when we did not use our great influence which we had then to persuade Batista to permit free elections and a return to constitutional government , and let the Cuban people pick his successor , instead of letting Castro seize it in almost a palace revolution . Thirdly , I think that in the problem of Cuba we have to work with the other - the Organization of the American States , and I am most concerned , not only that we isolate Cuba , but that we attempt to isolate the Cuban revolution from the rest of South America .	Oh , the problems are great . In Cuba , in the Congo , in the Near East , all over the world , there are problems with which we are confronted and we will continue to be confronted with them in the years ahead .

There are 17 million Americans and there is not anyone here who does not have a part of his family or he , himself or she , herself , will be some day in the same position .	It will meet it honestly . It will do a better job , and I resent the attacks of our opponents when they say we are against health care for the aged and they 're for it because , as I will tell you , we are for the only program that will do the job , and theirs wo n't do the job , and it 's time that they be called on it .

You can sum it up in five words : The Republicans have vetoed Pennsylvania .

All of western Pennsylvania , including this county , would have been eligible .	Nixon_October_19_1960	Kennedy_October_15_1960

We 're always going to be willing to go the extra mile to negotiate disarmament or anything , but we 're never going to fall into the fatal error of what has got us in war in the past and that is let dictators think that we will not react . So , this is the way to peace , and I want you to know that we will have no greater obligation than to keep the peace for ourselves , for our children , and also to see to it that our children have an opportunity to grow up and have a better life even than we 've had .	This administration , a year ago , in order to get a position on disarmament , appointed a lawyer from my own State of Massachusetts , Mr. Coolidge , who had had no previous experience in the field . After 3 months , his report was dismissed and so was he , and a New York lawyer , after 5 weeks of preparation , was sent to head up our mission to the Disarmament Conference .

0561	medical care,health care	no_relation	Now , people disagree with that . Senator Kennedy and Senator Johnson believe that the social security route , which would compel all people - whether they wanted health insurance or not - to , in effect , have it through subscribing to social security , is the best one to provide medical care or people over 65 . I believe that the most effective method is through a program which will provide a choice whereby people who want to have the protection for catastrophic illnesses or , for that matter , for noncatastrophic illnesses , if they so desire , can have it , but where they are not forced to have it if they do not desire , and where they can choose getting that protection through government or through private plans , which they might choose , with some government assistance .	I refer , of course , to the Social Security Act of 1935 . It is particularly appropriate that we mark that anniversary by the extension of the system to include medical care insurance for our older citizens . A quarter of a century ago , the people of the United States turned their back on the dole and the means test , and chose instead to rely on self-financed insurance , paid through the social security system , to protect themselves against the hazards of old age .

I know that you must never agree to disarmament , for example , unless you have an ironclad agreement from him that he 's going to do likewise . I know that that kind of firmness is what leads to peace .	We did not come up with a single major new proposal in the field of arms control , and we cared so little about it that we regarded the entire effort as merely a part of our effort in psychological warfare . At the London Conference of 1957 , the first important disarmament Conference held in the fifties , and the one which came closest of any in reaching an agreement on disarmament , we sent a man who had not been active in the field , Harold Stassen , we sent him to a meeting without formulating an American position .

Six out of seven Republicans on that conference voted against that not only the $ 1.25 minimum wage , but also against the President 's own program which we finally offered as a compromise .	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .

All of the programs that serve our people , that advance our country , that provide this country with vigor and vitality , education , security for our aged citizens under medical care under social security , all these programs have been initiated by the party which we lead in this campaign . And as you look at the sixties and recognize the need for new resolutions to new problems , I ca n't believe that this country will entrust the leadership to a candidate and a party that have opposed progress in the last 25 years .	We 're not going to because the American people recognize that good times are with us today and that they can be better tomorrow . So , if we 're not going to have a recession , how about our programs for progress for the future ? Well , here , as you might expect , the voter again is confronted with a real problem , because I say that I have programs that will produce progress , better schools and better housing for all Americans , a program of medical care for the aged , a program that will expand job opportunities for all of our people ; a program in the field of civil rights that sees that all Americans move forward together , leaving none behind .

0567	unemployment	no_relation	Fourth , we must move to meet the growing crisis of automation - the replacement of men by machines - which has already thrown thousands of men out of work here in Michigan and which threatens the jobs of millions of men throughout the country . In the past 8 years nothing has been done to harness automation to serve the welfare of all our people , rather than permitting it to become an instrument of economic distress and unemployment . In 1961 , a Democratic President will call a conference of leaders of industry and labor to formulate new programs for dealing with the problems of automation .	Have you ever talked to a Negro mother as I have ? Have you ever heard her tell you , try to explain to a child in the South ? How do you explain that she can go into a store and buy a loaf of bread but ca n't sit at the counter and have a Coca - Cola ? This makes you understand that it is n't enough just to pass laws ; it is n't enough just to make speeches , but what you have to do is do what the Attorney General of the United States must do , not just a lot of promises and talk , but get in the leaders of chainstores and get them to agree to break down this barrier so that we can remove this block from the people of this country and our Nation . What about unemployment ? How can you believe me when I say I will move this economy forward , that we will use all the power of this Government to fight unemployment , to fight recession ; but , more than that , we 're going to use it in a positive way to stimulate employment , to open new avenues for expansion of economy ? How do you know ? How can you believe me ? I 'll tell you why . Because I know what it means .	Kennedy_October_14_1960	Nixon_October_5_1960

They voted 90 percent against social security in the midthirties , and they voted 90 percent against the medical care for the aged tied to social security in 1960 . This is the party which has stood still , and I do n't believe in 1960 any American can stand still .	And now , if I could spell it out in two or three directions .

The arms control research institute would coordinate and direct all these research efforts , carrying them on itself or farming them out to private firms and universities . The scattered disarmament technicians , scientists , and policymakers could at last work as a unit with a central purpose and direction given by the President himself .

It is a matter of record that Republicans have extended social security and strengthened minimum wage legislation . Moreover , we care too much for people to advocate programs , as my opponent does , which would raise Federal spending by over $ 15 billion a year - programs so great they could be paid for , not out of miracles of economic growth , but by 180 million Americans in higher taxes and higher prices .	Fact : In 1938 , when the first bill was passed , the Republicans voted against it 48 to 31 in the House and 13 to 2 in the Senate . Fact : When the minimum wage was raised from 40 cents to 75 cents an hour , every Republican on the House Labor Committee opposed it and the Republicans in the House voted 143 to 12 to take away minimum wage protection from 1 million workers who were covered . Fact : In 1960 , the attempt to raise the minimum wage to $ 1.25 an hour was defeated in the House when Republicans voted 119 to 27 against it .	Nixon_October_29_1960	Kennedy_October_20_1960

To assure a vital economy , he promises a minimum wage that official studies show would force unemployment and business failures . To protect the unfortunate , he promises to give the wealthiest people in American a helping hand with medical costs in their later years , while withholding help from some 3 million people with incomes of $ 2,000 or less ; in fact , in the name of freedom he would force this medical program on one and all , save the 3 million who need help the most .	He did not equivocate , because he was the President of the United States . The Lincoln tradition is not found in a man who considers $ 1.25 minimum wage to be , and I quote him  extreme .  The Lincoln tradition of courage [ applause ] is not found in a man who considers Federal aid for education and teachers salaries to be  extreme ,  and I quote him accurately , and who calls helping our older citizens through the medium of social security to provide medical care for their aged life - who considers that to be  extreme .

Nothing at all .	[ Applause . ] I divide the issues which face us as a country domestically into two categories : First , I think it is necessary that we finish the job which Wilson and Roosevelt began , the fight for medical care for the aged , for minimum wage of $ 1.25 , for Federal aid to education , for housing , for a better life for all Americans under a system of equality for all Americans , and then I say that there are new problems which Woodrow Wilson , Franklin Roosevelt , and Harry Truman never heard of in their generation . In my race for the Presidency I traveled in many primaries and in many States , in the deserted textile towns ot New Hampshire , in the deserted farms of Wisconsin , in the deserted coal mines of West Virginia , in the lumber fields of Oregon , where men were out of work , even though we needed housing .

We have dealt with this threat to the peace and stability of the hemisphere as we pledged we would in our solemn treaty commitments .	Secondly , in the case of Cuba , I think the basic error was made in the last stage of Batista , when we did not use our great influence which we had then to persuade Batista to permit free elections and a return to constitutional government , and let the Cuban people pick his successor , instead of letting Castro seize it in almost a palace revolution . Thirdly , I think that in the problem of Cuba we have to work with the other - the Organization of the American States , and I am most concerned , not only that we isolate Cuba , but that we attempt to isolate the Cuban revolution from the rest of South America . I think that is the big danger , that from Cuba as a base they will expand their power .	Nixon_September_12_1960	Kennedy_September_6_1960

If you believe that the area redevelopment bill , which has been vetoed twice , which would mean so much to this community and other communities , which are hard hit by chronic unemployment , and you want it vetoed a third time , you should vote for Mr. Nixon .	We say that in the field of education we are proud that we stand for a program that will build more schools , that will raise the levels of our teachers ' salaries , but which rejects the program that they have that would endanger the right of the States to control education and that would , in effect , give to the Federal government the power not only to pay teachers , but to tell them what to teach - and that must never happen in the United States of America . We say that the answer to the problem of health care for our old people is our way and not theirs . Why ? Because ours is a program which leaves to the individual the choice , the choice of what he wants in the way of protection .	Kennedy_October_4_1960	Nixon_October_3_1960

So , I say to you : America should not take a chance on inexperienced leadership , however well intentioned it is , when you have experienced leadership that know these men and will deal with them effectively in the years ahead . And , now , if I may turn to one final point , and I mention this particularly to this group here , because there are some students here : Necessarily , in a campaign we have to discuss what we term the so-called hard issues in terms of foreign policy , specific issues like Cuba , Quemoy and Matsu , Lebanon , et cetera , and there is a tendency for Americans to forget the really important asset that we have in this great struggle in which we 're engaged . You know what it is ? It is n't our great military strength , and it is n't our great economic strength , and these are both tremendously significant and necessary ; but the strength of America is in what we believe .

0580	unemployment	attack	A real  truth squad ,  for example , would find it necessary to ask Mr. Nixon such questions as these : 1. Why do you repeat the statement that real wages have gone up 15 percent during the present administration compared with only 2 percent in the previous one , when your own Department of Labor figures clearly establish that the increase between September 1945 ( the first postwar month ) and January 1953 was 18.3 percent while the increase between January 1953 and August 1960 has been 13.7 percent . 2. Why have you not personally admitted that you misquoted me when you said that in my Detroit speech on Labor Day I had said  What the American labor movement wants for America is what I want for America  when this statement did not appear in either my advance statement or in the speech as actually delivered ? 3. When you insist that Federal aid to teachers salaries means Federal control over education , are you aware of the fact that the present program for aid to federally impacted areas has been free of such control , and that the provision which you killed with your tie-breaking vote contained explicit language ruling out any Federal  direction , supervision , or control over the policy determinations , personnel , program of instruction , or the administration or operation of any school or school system  ? 4. How can you claim credit for the present administration for more new water project starts than any other time in our history , when the stated Republican position except in campaign election years has been a no-new-starts policy that the Democratic Congress has sought to overcome ? 5. How can you call the vetoed 1960 Democratic bill on depressed areas  straight pork barrel  when your own Secretary of Labor , just 24 hours before the veto was announced , called the bill  good enough so that any Senator or Congressman from a State with areas of chronic unemployment would have no alternative but vote for it  ? 6. Why do you take credit for the present levels of operations at the National Institutes of Health , when the Democratic Congress , ignoring threats of veto , raised the administration request from $ 400 million to $ 560 million for the present year - the sixth consecutive year that Democrats have raised administration requests ? 7. On October 5 , in Philadelphia , you talked about civil rights and said ,  My position and that of my running mate has been clear and straightforward . We have said the same thing in every section of the country .	But we can always do better and I am determined that we shall do better in quickening the pace of our economic advance and in minimizing interruptions to it . I am determined to undertake every sensible measure to that end , to lift to ever higher levels the number of jobs in America , to reduce unemployment further , and to utilize more fully our industrial capacity in steel and other lines To achieve that goal we must release fully the greatest creative force in human affairs - the spirit of individual enterprise in 180 million Americans . That effort calls for a many-sided program which I have been developing , and will continue to develop , in this campaign .	Kennedy_October_20_1960	Nixon_October_19_1960
0581	unemployment	attack	It is sound . We have seen unemployment move down last month more than seasonally and employment rise more than seasonally . New car sales are moving up .	I am not talking about prosperity for our largest banks , our largest defense contractors , or our largest investors who have made record profits under the high interest rate procurement and tax policies of this administration . I am talking about prosperity for all the people - for the women in some of our largest stores who are being paid 65 cents an hour - for the retired cutter who can not pay his medical bills on an average social security check of $ 72 a month - for the unemployed fitter who must support his family on an unemployment check averaging less than $ 35 a week - for the Negro accountant who has to take a job as a messenger - for the Puerto Rican lawyer who has to drive a truck - the children who have to grow up in overcrowded slums and go to overcrowded schools - they are not sharing in what Mr. Nixon calls unprecedented prosperity . But to meet their needs effectively , according to Mr. Nixon , would take higher taxes or inflation .	Nixon_October_28_1960	Kennedy_October_27_1960

Every time the President vetoes a housing bill , every time a Republican Member votes against the $ 1.25 minimum wage , every time we are unable to get any support on our bill to tie medical care for the aged to social security , it is not the Congress that suffers , it is not the administration ; it is the people of the United States who require , in my opinion , a progressive , forward-looking government if this country is going to move forward . It is no accident that 400,000 people in a rich State like Pennsylvania wait every month for surplus food packages from the Federal Government .	Nixon_September_29_1960	Kennedy_September_16_1960

What would that have done ? It would have decimated the people of that island .	No other task is more important . For remember that the polls will not open next Tuesday , or any other day in any real sense , in Moscow or in Peiping - or in Mr. Castro 's Cuba - or in the so-called satellite nations where I found no satellite peoples . We must vote on behalf of those peoples next Tuesday as well as ourselves - on behalf of all those who want to vote for the cause of freedom but lack the freedom to vote .

0586	disarmament	attack	We have not only taken one step ; we have not only taken two steps , but we have gone the second mile , the third mile , way down the line on disarmament . The point is : the Soviet Union is blocking the road to disarmament , blocking the road to stopping tests . Why ? Because they want a closed society and they want no inspection .	We can not parley on the basis of equality with the Soviet unless we maintain a military position of equality with them , and that goes in the traditional weapons and in missiles and in outer space . One of the reasons why we have never been able to get an agreement on the disarmament of outer space is because we are second in outer space , and the Soviet Union will not give way their advantage . We arm to parley , and we must be strong if we are going to disarm and maintain our security .	Nixon_October_27_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
0587	disarmament	no_relation	We are already racing from the jet age to the space age before meeting the safety , airport development , and other problems of the former . Space exploration that unravels the secrets of our universe , reconnaissance satellites that can replace a hundred U-2 planes watching over all the world , civilian travel in space vehicles , and the rule of law and disarmament in space itself , all these lie ahead of this generation . But we need not look only to the skies for new horizons .	Whenever that balance changes , whenever the Soviet Union gains strength as against our strength , war 's danger increases , because they are wanting to use their strength not as we are , for peace , but to conquer the world . So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war . That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests .

0588	medical care,health care	no_relation	And I do n't blame Mr. Nixon for trying to forget the record of a party which has opposed virtually every single Democratic measure designed to improve human welfare in this century , a party which has not initiated a single piece of forward looking social legislation since the time of William Howard Taft . Mr. Nixon did not ignore party affiliations between elections , when he led the Republican opposition to increased minimum wages , medical care for the aged , aid to education , help for distressed areas , and all the rest and the American people are not going to ignore Mr. Nixon 's party affiliation next week . The third Nixon theme is an attack on the policies of the Democratic Party .	I know what it means to meet a family budget . I remember , as far as medical care is concerned , the day and the year that my father died , in 1956 . We had lots of medical bills that year .	Kennedy_October_30_1960	Nixon_October_29_1960
0589	unemployment	attack	[ Applause . ] The Republican Party has never broken through new ground , has never stood for progress , has opposed step by step every piece of progressive legislation passed for the benefit of the people in the last 25 years , housing , social security , minimum wage , unemployment compensation - all of the things which make it possible for us to build a strong and vital society . I ask you to join us in 1960 .	We 'll see that we move ahead in science . We will see to it that we have social security and unemployment insurance , that we will extend all of these things that are good for America and that Americans need , but I say to you also , as President , that there will be certainly not one dollar spent that does n't need to be spent . And here you 've got a choice .	Kennedy_October_27_1960	Nixon_October_22_1960
0591	medical care,health care	attack	But the record is written in the Congress , day in and day out . On medical care for the aged tied to social security , which would cost 3 cents a day per person , an average of $ 12 a year it would insure any person retiring that they would receive medical care , nursing care , the cost of their medicine . Now , under the bill which the President signed , if you get sick and you are retired , and you have saved up $ 500 or $ 800 , you have to first exhaust all of that for medical bills , then you take a pauper 's oath that you are medically indigent .	We want to move forward as this district has moved forward . We want better schools , better housing , better medical care , everything that has made America the greatest country in the world , that will make her even greater , because let 's understand one thing here today above everything else : America has n't been standing still . She 's been moving .	Kennedy_October_15_1960	Nixon_October_14_1960
0592	cuba	no_relation	I believe this matter is so fundamental to decency in world affairs that until Red China has proved her adherence to these standards by her deeds and not just by her words , the next President should consider a veto , which we have never used , to be fully justified by the United States in the National Security Council - a veto of any effort to admit a nation that does not comply , as Red China does not comply . And now I want to turn to one other subject at hand , much closer , the problem of Cuba , a very difficult problem . People have often said ,  Mr .	Mr. Nixon himself was in Latin America 5 years ago and here is what he said :  If we had produced economic progress in Cuba we might have averted the Cuban takeover .  Why did n't we ? That is what he said a month ago ; why did n't we in 1955 come forward with a program that would have prevented Castro from taking power ? When he was there in 1955 , he said , and you can judge his experience ,  I am convinced that communism has passed its highwater mark in Latin America ,  at a time when the Communists were about to communize Cuba . Our third failure has been our inability to establish contact with the young people of that area that will run the country .	Nixon_October_18_1960	Kennedy_October_18_1960

This campaign is a fight for all those programs which Franklin Roosevelt fought for in his time , medical care for the aged tied to social security . Mr. Nixon says that is extreme .	That 's what the program will buy for you . A compulsory medical care program - and I will have more to say about that in a moment . A teachers ' program , an education program , which differs from ours in this fundamental : It would take our teachers and put them directly under the Federal Government as far as subsidization of their salaries is concerned , and the net result of that would give the inevitable power to the Federal Government to tell our teachers what to teach - and we do n't want that in Washington .

0595	cuba	no_relation	[ Applause . ] I have asked Mr. Nixon to participate in a fifth debate which I think should cover the question of Cuba and other important problems facing the American people . I still find it impossible to understand why Mr. Nixon wants to limit the debate to one subject where there are so many important problems facing the American people .	Thus far these fighters for freedom have had virtually no support from our Government .  This clearly means , as the New York Times Washington correspondent , James Reston , reported in today 's paper :  His statement this week on Cuba , publicly calling for Government aid to overthrow Castro , is a clear violation of the inter-American treaty prohibition against intervention in the internal affairs of the hemisphere Republics .  Thus it is clear that you and I are diametrically opposed on a matter of great public interest and one which the next President may have to deal with as soon as he assumes the office .

What monetary and fiscal policies will we follow , which will provide full employment for our people ? How will we protect their unemployment compensation if they are out of work ? How will we be sure that they are adequately cared for when they are searching for work ? How will we take care of our children and make sure that they have the best educational system in the world ? Those of you who work for a living know that your children must be well educated if they are going to work their way in the 1960 's and the 1970 's . Industry is changing-steel and all the rest .	Have you ever talked to a Negro mother as I have ? Have you ever heard her tell you , try to explain to a child in the South ? How do you explain that she can go into a store and buy a loaf of bread but ca n't sit at the counter and have a Coca - Cola ? This makes you understand that it is n't enough just to pass laws ; it is n't enough just to make speeches , but what you have to do is do what the Attorney General of the United States must do , not just a lot of promises and talk , but get in the leaders of chainstores and get them to agree to break down this barrier so that we can remove this block from the people of this country and our Nation . What about unemployment ? How can you believe me when I say I will move this economy forward , that we will use all the power of this Government to fight unemployment , to fight recession ; but , more than that , we 're going to use it in a positive way to stimulate employment , to open new avenues for expansion of economy ?

Three times in this campaign - on Quemoy and Matsu , on Cuba , at Paris - my opponent would have done differently from the President , and that could have led to either war or surrender . My friends , I say that we can not use the White House as a training school for a man to get experience , as President of the United States , at the expense of the American people .	We have to research and prepare effective arms control plans under a single agency , and not leave this terribly complex matter to less than 100 people scattered throughout Washington - one-fifth as many people as work on cemeteries and memorials for the U.S. Battle Monuments Commission . We can not avoid the menace of a Communist base in Cuba , only 90 miles away from our shores merely by wishing it had n't happened . For Castro is not the only problem , and if we are not careful , he may not be the only  Castro  in power .	Nixon_November_4_1960	Kennedy_November_4_1960
0601	unemployment	no_relation	We come from all continents , from all countries , from all races and all religions and what better evidence of it than here ? I recall talking to Mr. Herbert Hoover at the time he was working with me on the Hungarian refugee problems , trying to develop programs for the refugees . Concern was expressed at that time about changing our immigration laws to allow more refugees to come in , concern with regard to the effect on employment and unemployment in this country , concern as to how these people could be assimilated . His answer was that every wave of refugees that has come to the United States has strengthened America rather than weakened it .	 If it remains there it is entitled to special Government help through defense procurement and other programs . But today the unemployment rate for the entire Nation is nearly 6 percent . The whole United States is rapidly becoming an area of substantial labor surplus .	Nixon_September_19_1960	Kennedy_September_19_1960
0602	minimum wage	attack	And this administration says , when we try to provide aid to education , when we try to provide medical care for the aged , it is too extreme . When we try to pass $ 1.25 minimum wage , per hour , $ 50 a week [ applause ] $ 50 a week , Mr. Nixon says it is extreme . Mr. Nixon represents the same party that in the midthirties voted 90 percent against social security , 90 percent against the minimum wage of 25 cents an hour , and in 1960 voted 90 percent against the $ 1.25 minimum wage , and medical care for the aged tied to social security .	The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve . In 1960 , this administration sought to extend minimum wage coverage to 3.1 million additional workers and indicated support of an increase in the minimum wage to $ 1.15 per hour . The misstatement : In the first debate Senator Kennedy said that the Republican Party gives only  lipservice  to programs of medical care for the aged .	Kennedy_October_28_1960	Nixon_October_19_1960
0603	medical care,health care	attack	And to meet the pressing problem confronting men past working age , and their families , we must put through an effective program of medical care for the aged under the social security system . The present medical care program will not send one penny to needy persons without further action by the Congress and the State legislatures . It imposes an ugly needs test-a  pauper 's oath  - for eligibility .	They are different from the ones he advocates . The fact that they are different , however , does n't give him the right to say , as he did when he was in Minnesota , that I and my party are against medical care for the aged , that we are against better schools , that we are against better housing , that we are against better conditions of employment for our people . All that I can say is that when he says that he is simply talking in terms of the promises he makes , and if he had produced anything in his promises , he might have a right to talk , but he has n't done a thing yet and he has nothing to recommend him to elect him President of the United States on the basis of the special session .

We had no position and we adopted that of the British .	I select it because I believe it is the most important issue not only of this campaign , but of our time , of our generation , of this country . I select it because I know that the people of this State as the people of the other 49 States of the Union , want leadership which will continue to do what President Eisenhower has done , and for which the American people will be forever grateful to him , leadership that will keep the peace , keep it without surrender , leadership that will extend freedom , extend it without war , leadership which will make us proud of our Nation in the council of nations , leadership in which the President of the United States , when he goes to the United Nations , as a man of dignity , standing for disarmament , standing for progress , standing for helping the unfortunate people of the world , and gaining respect rather than making a fool out of himself as did Mr. Khrushchev when he was there at the United Nations - and I know that everybody in this audience , everybody listening to me on television and radio , recognizes that the problems are difficult , difficult not because of our choosing , difficult not because of the other peace-loving nations - and , fortunately , my friends , they are most of the nations in this world , our allies in Europe and in Asia , the so-called neutrals in Africa , and in South America , and in other countries . Certainly in this period we realize that the problems are difficult only because there is on the loose in the world a great aggressive force , a force which is fanatical which is ruthless , whose leaders do not follow the rules of international diplomacy , as we would like them to be followed , whose leaders - and I know them , and I speak from knowledge - are men who have one objective , and one only , and that is to conquer the world , conquer it without war , if they can , but willing to use any means , if that becomes necessary , and because when we have this kind of leadership , aggressive , always probing , always attempting to embarrass , always moving against us around the world , the period ahead is going to be a difficult one .	Kennedy_October_23_1960	Nixon_October_22_1960
0605	minimum wage	no_relation	Meanwhile , the contradictory statements of Senator Kennedy still leave him opposed to this position . The misstatement : In the second debate Senator Kennedy said : The Republicans in recent years , not only in the last 25 years , but in the last 8 years , have opposed * * * minimum wage * * The facts : Senator Kennedy is saying that Republicans who opposed his particular bill are against minimum wage . The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve .	Let me say , briefly , I believe there are two points . First , those of you who are active in labor , those of you who lead organized labor movements , are concerned about the welfare of your people and concerned about the welfare of the general public , and you know very well , perhaps better than anyone , that this country still has unfinished business , that we have to maintain full employment , that we have to advance the standards of living of our people , of better housing , of better minimum wage , of medical care for the aged . Franklin Roosevelt could put forward a minimum wage of 25 cents an hour in 1935 , but that does not mean the job was finished .	Nixon_October_19_1960	Kennedy_October_19_1960
0608	unemployment	attack	What we have done in the Eisenhower administration is that we have developed policies that have brought high employment but without war , and I can assure you that we are going to do everything we can to expand the economy , to continue to see that those Americans who want to work will be able to get work . My last point is this : Look at the unemployment figures . They are going down every month .	Every piece of important legislation of benefit to our people was opposed by the Republicans when they first came into being , away back to the Federal Reserve Board , all the reforms of the Roosevelt administration , social security , all the others , minimum wage , housing , benefits to the farmers , all opposed . Now , with that long history , TVA , the development of our resources , all in opposition , with that long history , how can we expect that that party and that candidate can move this country ahead , with all the changes coming on , the prospects for unemployment , the recession possibly this winter in 1961 , with our farm income down 25 percent , with 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls never seeing the inside of a college , who graduate from high school , our prestige in the world being affected , with Communists on the march , Castro on the march . I believe the United States has to make a decision .	Nixon_November_7_1960	Kennedy_November_7_1960
0609	medical care,health care	attack	From now until November 8 we are taking our ease to the forum in which it belongs , where there is no threat of veto , where there is no parliamentary obstruction , and where we will be successful - and that is the forum of the American people . Until a Democrat is in the White house , the Republicans can block action on an adequate minimum wage , they can water down medical care for the aged , they can play politics with civil rights , they can block action on a decent housing bill and a good school bill . But they can not block the American people on November 8. The theme of this campaign is going to be action - action at home to keep pace with our growing needs , to help the unfortunate , to build a still greater nation - and action abroad , to match the rise in Communist power , to meet the turbulent revolutions reshaping our globe .	I believe that the most effective method is through a program which will provide a choice whereby people who want to have the protection for catastrophic illnesses or , for that matter , for noncatastrophic illnesses , if they so desire , can have it , but where they are not forced to have it if they do not desire , and where they can choose getting that protection through government or through private plans , which they might choose , with some government assistance . And I would agree with Senator Kennedy , incidentally , to this extent : he indicated that this would be an issue in the campaign , I think it will be an issue in the campaign , and the question will not be one of ends , because both of us believe that there should he protection for our older citizens for medical care . The question will be one of means .	Kennedy_September_3_1960	Nixon_August_24_1960
0610	unemployment	no_relation	Listening to the opposition , one would never know that there are almost 68 million Americans at work in our $ 500 billion economy and that Americans are earning at a record annual rate of over $ 408 billion . One will never learn from my opponent that employment declined less than seasonally last month and that unemployment went down more than seasonally . Unemployment dropped not only as to number but also as a percentage of the labor force .	But that means $ 3,000 more he pays for that house before he pays off his mortgage , and that is one reason why housing starts are off 20 percent this year , even though our population is increasing by 3 million a year . That is why there is unemployment in lumberyards and that is why some of our mills in Oregon are closing down . In 1952 , a typical school district wanting to build a million-dollar school faced interest on their bonds of $ 328,000 .	Nixon_October_19_1960	Kennedy_October_17_1960
0612	unemployment	support	I was the floor manager and as chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor brought the first area redevelopment bill to the floor of the Senate . We passed that bill for depressed areas , and I represented a number of them - the city of Lawrence Mass , had 30 percent unemployment for 4 years . I brought that bill and managed it through the Senate .	We 'll see that we move ahead in science . We will see to it that we have social security and unemployment insurance , that we will extend all of these things that are good for America and that Americans need , but I say to you also , as President , that there will be certainly not one dollar spent that does n't need to be spent . And here you 've got a choice .	Kennedy_October_28_1960	Nixon_October_22_1960
0613	medical care,health care	attack	Vocational training and other educational programs are prime cases in point , where we can buy invaluable lead-time against the problems of the aged by starting with persons of middle age . One of the most important preventives of all would be to accelerate the use of private medical care insurance programs which would enable people of working age to take adequate action to safeguard their health . I think we should give immediate consideration to allowing tax deductions for the cost of health insurance , designed to protect them against catastrophic illnesses that place crippling burdens on our families .	And I do n't blame Mr. Nixon for trying to forget the record of a party which has opposed virtually every single Democratic measure designed to improve human welfare in this century , a party which has not initiated a single piece of forward looking social legislation since the time of William Howard Taft . Mr. Nixon did not ignore party affiliations between elections , when he led the Republican opposition to increased minimum wages , medical care for the aged , aid to education , help for distressed areas , and all the rest and the American people are not going to ignore Mr. Nixon 's party affiliation next week . The third Nixon theme is an attack on the policies of the Democratic Party .	Nixon_October_30_1960	Kennedy_October_30_1960
0614	disarmament	attack	Whenever that balance changes , whenever the Soviet Union gains strength as against our strength , war 's danger increases , because they are wanting to use their strength not as we are , for peace , but to conquer the world . So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war . That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests .	The struggle for disarmament will not be an easy one . For disarmament is an ideal just as peace itself is an ideal , but it was a great son of Wisconsin , Carl Schurz , who said : Ideals are like stars ; you will not succeed in touching them with your hands . But , like the seafaring man on the desert of waters , you choose them as your guides , and following them you will reach your destiny .	Nixon_October_27_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
0615	disarmament	attack	Halt the arms race .  Let me tell you about disarmament . When people say ,  I 'm for disarmament ,  and when some people write to me and say  Why , when Mr. Khrushchev comes over and says he 's for total disarmament - why do we have to insist on inspection ? Why ,  they say ,  could n't we just do it ? Would n't that be real leadership in the world ? Would n't that be bold and imaginative ?  Yes , it would ; but do you know what would happen ? The moment the United States ever enters into an agreement for disarmament , which would result in increasing his strength as against ours , we do n't help the cause of peace .	The arms control research institute would coordinate and direct all these research efforts , carrying them on itself or farming them out to private firms and universities . The scattered disarmament technicians , scientists , and policymakers could at last work as a unit with a central purpose and direction given by the President himself . Third - we must begin , perhaps within the framework of the arms control research institute , to plan for the reconversion of our economy from war to peace .	Nixon_October_25_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
0618	disarmament	support	Secondly , peace requires an America that is planning , preparing , and striving for disarmament and other steps toward peace . Disarmament today is just as complicated as armaments - involving complex problems of surveillance , reconnaissance , seismography , atmospheric sampling and testing stations . A successful blueprint for a safe disarmament is as difficult to devise as a successful blueprint for modern war .	[ Applause . ] And the reason that we insist that disarmament must not be just a fine slogan but that it must be honest and that there must be an agreement which will see that both sides keep it is not because we do not want disarmament but because we do want disarmament . We want the fact of disarmament rather than the fiction of it which is what the Soviets up to this time have been offering , since they have not offered inspection along with it .

0619	unemployment	no_relation	That was the Truman recession of 1949 . Unemployment jumped to almost 5 million . What saved the opposition this time from a dragging economy ? The Korean war .	[ Applause . ] As long as there are 15 million Americans who live in substandard homes , as long as the average wage for laundry women in five large cities of the United States , and most of them are Negroes , is 65 cents for a 48-hour week , as long as the average unemployment compensation check in this rich country is less than $ 31 a week for a man out of work to support his family , as long as nearly 5 million Americans live on a surplus food package from the Government that amounts to 5 cents a day per person , as long as in Cuba and in other places in Latin America , as long as Africa , begins to turn against us , as long as we no longer possess an image in the world of a society on the move , so long is there need for our party on this occasion , and I come and ask your support . [ Applause .	Nixon_October_19_1960	Kennedy_October_17_1960
0620	disarmament	attack	We must take advantage of these new technological discoveries , and we must move forward also because the Soviet is moving forward , and we must never let this gap , which presently exists between their strength and ours , a gap in our favor , be narrowed . As a matter of fact , we must increase it , increase it until the time comes when we can have real disarmament with inspection - and more about that later . In addition to this , of course , we need intelligence activities , and I want to talk very frankly about intelligence tonight , because this is a matter that has been discussed during this campaign , as you will recall , in our debates .	The enemy advances now by nonmilitary methods - and military methods can not prevent that advance . Disarmament planning is one of the most glaring failures of these last 8 years . There have been a series of opportunities , conferences , and proposals by other nations including the Russians .	Nixon_November_3_1960	Kennedy_November_2_1960
0621	minimum wage	attack	The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve . In 1960 , this administration sought to extend minimum wage coverage to 3.1 million additional workers and indicated support of an increase in the minimum wage to $ 1.15 per hour . The misstatement : In the first debate Senator Kennedy said that the Republican Party gives only  lipservice  to programs of medical care for the aged .	I do n't think the monetary and fiscal policies which this administration has followed are good enough . I believe that when they stand against the minimum wage of $ 1.25 an hour , I think they are standing in the way of progress . We have high interest rates and as a partial result we built this year 200,000 less homes than we needed in this country to stay up with our population .	Nixon_October_19_1960	Kennedy_October_15_1960
0622	cuba	no_relation	[ Cheers and applause . ] Now , of course , I recognize that he has indicated that now he 's changed his mind , that now he thinks he 's supporting the President 's position on that , and with regard to the President 's conduct at the summit conference , and with regard to the President 's policies in Cuba and in the other areas where he 's been critical ; but I can only suggest this : As Cabot Lodge has already implied , and as he and I both know from experience , when a President speaks , when a President makes a decision , it 's for keeps . He does n't get a second chance .	If we have purpose and direction and force , then what we are will speak far louder than what we say . Mr. Nixon chose to devote his speech here to Cuba . If there would be one topic that I would be reluctant to discuss if I were Republican , it would be Cuba .	Nixon_October_31_1960	Kennedy_October_28_1960
0623	unemployment	no_relation	It is no wonder that in the 1920 's the recession and depression of 1929 was preceded by the sharpest decline in agricultural income that the country had seen up to that date . And now here in Indiana , and in this city of Terre Haute , you have unemployment of nearly 7 percent , you see steel mills in Gary and elsewhere in this State which are working 55 or 60 percent of capacity , and every merchant and every banker in the State of Indiana can tell you that this September and this October have been as difficult and hard as the September and October of 1957 , and the September and October at the end of 1953 , which preceded the recessions of 1954 and 1958 . I do n't believe this country can afford another recession .	And , so I want to make clear where we do stand . I favor programs , programs that are constructive , programs that will work , programs that will produce progress ; more schools , a breakthrough in science , a breakthrough in medical care and medical research , progress in terms of better jobs for the American people , raising the minimum standards as far as our minimum wage , and our unemployment coverage is concerned . All of these things I stand for , but I want to make one thing clear : As far as the cost of my programs are concerned , they are billions less than what my opponent 's would cost .

That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests .	Perhaps the science of inspection will be unable to keep pace with advancing weapons technology . But no matter how difficult the problems are , how discouraging the obstacles , how uncertain the prospect for agreement , we must , nevertheless , begin a determined , large-scale effort to prepare ourselves for disarmament - to formulate constructive and realistic proposals which have a chance of success . For the hopes of all mankind rest on successful disarmament .	Nixon_October_27_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
0627	unemployment	no_relation	In 1939 , when war came in Europe , unemployment in America , after 6 futile years of their trying to solve it , stood just under 9 ½ million . Let 's face it : It took war to solve the unemployment riddle for them . After the war was over opposition spokesmen forecast some 6 million unemployed .	[ Applause . ] Twice the Congress of the United States has passed legislation to aid areas where there is high unemployment . Senator Clark fought for the second bill , I was the floor manager for the first bill , the distressed area bill , the area redevelopment bill , and twice this administration vetoed that bill , which would have helped this county and would have helped Sharon .

0628	disarmament	attack	And you ask about prestige . What do our opponents think ? Do they think that Mr. Khrushchev gains prestige for the Communists when he takes off his shoe at the United Nations and pounds the table with it ? I say no. I say that President Eisenhower gained prestige for America when with great dignity and great responsibility , he stood for peace , for disarmament , for all the things that Americans believe in. No , my friends , the real test of prestige , if our prestige was low , I can assure you , would occur in the United Nations , and there what do we find ? In every instance where we 've had a test vote - and listen to this - in the last 7 years , with the Soviet Union on one side and the United States on the other , we have won ; and in the vote on the Congo we won , 70 to nothing . My friends , that 's a pretty good score in football .	We have gone into every conference unprepared . This administration , a year ago , in order to get a position on disarmament , appointed a lawyer from my own State of Massachusetts , Mr. Coolidge , who had had no previous experience in the field . After 3 months , his report was dismissed and so was he , and a New York lawyer , after 5 weeks of preparation , was sent to head up our mission to the Disarmament Conference .

0629	unemployment	no_relation	Once again the economy surged to levels that they so like to cite . So what judgment is to be made of the opposition 's 20-year stewardship of the Nation 's economic affairs ? 1. Its policy was a tragic failure in solving the problem of unemployment during the peacetime years from 1933 to 1939 . 2. During the following 6 years , preparation for war and war itself solved the unemployment problem for them .	That should concern us all . 2. My second concern is unemployment . Between November 1957 and August 1960 the rate of jobless workers , seasonally adjusted , has been below 5 percent of the labor force in only 3 months out of 34 .	Nixon_October_19_1960	Kennedy_October_12_1960
0631	minimum wage	no_relation	I think , as you are aware , you actually have three bills which are potentially before the Congress . You have the Kennedy bill , which would raise the minimum wage on a graduated basis to a dollar and a quarter in 3 years , and which would expand coverage to 5 million people not presently covered . You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase .	The bill has two major purposes . First , it will raise the minimum wage now received by 2 1/2 million workers from $ 1.10 to $ 1.25 an hour . Second , it will extend the protection of the Fair Labor Standards Act to 5 million additional employees , chiefly in large-scale interstate retail and service industries , thereby guaranteeing these employees a fair minimum wage and a just premium for overtime .

0632	disarmament	no_relation	Mr. Nixon may now say he has been urging an acceleration of our defense all along - but in his August 10 press conference the President said he knew of no such different viewpoint by the Vice President , adding :  Certainly if there is , he has n't come to me about it .  What was the Security Council doing while the Nation was undergoing this experience ? Why would anyone point with pride to presiding over successive blows to our security and prestige - Indochina , Hungary , Suez , Sputnik , the riots in Venezuela , the collapse of the summit , the riots in Japan , the collapse of the Baghdad Pact , the failure of disarmament , the U-2 fiasco , and now Cuba and the Congo ? Why would anyone boast about presiding over the Security Council during the years it rejected the now accepted findings of the Gaither report , the Killian report , and the Rockefeller report - during the years it held back our missiles and frustrated our efforts in Space - during the years it failed to come up with one new idea of any importance : for  Atoms for Peace  was a slogan , the Eisenhower Middle East Doctrine was a farce , the  open skies  plan was a gesture , and the Baghdad Pact was a failure . Mr. Nixon has presided , in short , over the decline of our national security .	I think you could get a resolution through in the forthcoming General Assembly that would accomplish a lot . Q. Mr. Ambassador , have you had time to catch up today on the Russian proposal for a kind of summit meeting in the General Assembly on disarmament ? A. Yes . I heard about it .	Kennedy_August_24_1960	Nixon_August_1_1960
0634	cuba	attack	Fifth , I have tried in this campaign to address myself to the real issues confronting America - the real issue is world freedom or world slavery . World peace or world war , stopping the Communist advance which in 8 years has penetrated deep into Asia , Africa , the Middle East and Latin America - taking over Cuba itself - without firing a single shot or losing a single soldier . That is the real issue - peace - and my greatest objective is peace because I know something of war .	And , worse still , it would have meant surrender at the conference table . And then the third instance , the instance of Cuba - here again shooting from the hip , but not in the Texas fashion , because he missed the mark completely [ cheers and applause ] shooting from the hip and , rather than following the President , who said we 'll handle this fellow , Castro , within our treaties by quarantining him economically and politically , he said : No; no. We 've got to go further than that . We 've got to break our treaties - and he did n't say that but that 's the way everything was interpreted .	Kennedy_November_4_1960	Nixon_November_3_1960
0636	cuba	attack	But what I do suggest is that at least we have some concern , some recognition , some idea of the changing nature of our times . The whole problem in Cuba is not a dialogue about Mr. Castro . The whole problem in Cuba is what is going to happen in the rest of Latin America , whose side is going to be successful in those areas , which system offers the hope to these people .	Now , before we go into this question , many people will say ,  But , Mr. Nixon , are you for Castro ? Do n't you think we ought to support the people that are against him ?  The question is not whether you 're for or against Castro . The question is : What do you do ? What can you properly do ? What can the great United States of America legally and properly do to help the people of Cuba get the kind of government they deserve ? And this is n't easy . It is n't the easy shooting-from-the-hip way that Senator Kennedy has suggested .	Kennedy_October_23_1960	Nixon_October_22_1960
0637	minimum wage	attack	Third , we must work to establish decent , adequate and fair national standards of unemployment compensation and minimum wages . The raising of the minimum wage and its extension to cover millions of unprotected American workers must be one of the first items on the agenda of the next administration . Our unemployment benefits , too , must be standardized and extended .	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .	Kennedy_September_2_1960	Nixon_August_13_1960
0639	minimum wage	no_relation	We were not as successful as I hoped we would be . But I think the real difficulty is the fact that on the two bills which were most controversial , the $ 1.25 minimum wage , and the aid to the aged and social security , we were informed in both cases that if those bills passed , the President would veto them . All the President has to do to stop action is to veto any bill and he needs , according to the Constitution , only one-third plus one of either body to sustain his veto .	I think , as you are aware , you actually have three bills which are potentially before the Congress . You have the Kennedy bill , which would raise the minimum wage on a graduated basis to a dollar and a quarter in 3 years , and which would expand coverage to 5 million people not presently covered . You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase .

When I said that I had no idea that you would make even a greater blunder about Cuba . Consequently , I will talk about not only Quemoy and Matsu but also about Cuba every day during the next 2 weeks - I will do this because I am deeply concerned about the policies you advocate in those two areas of the world which might well lead to abandoning free territory in the Far East , and a loss of all of our Latin American allies in this hemisphere or worse .	[ Applause . ] I have asked Mr. Nixon to participate in a fifth debate which I think should cover the question of Cuba and other important problems facing the American people . I still find it impossible to understand why Mr. Nixon wants to limit the debate to one subject where there are so many important problems facing the American people .	Nixon_October_24_1960	Kennedy_October_24_1960
0641	medical care,health care	attack	And this is all going to come at a time when automation and machinery is taking the place of men and women . I believe that we have to educate our children , that we have to provide jobs for those who want to work , that we have to provide security for those who have retired , particularly for medical care , that we must build in this country a strong and vital society which serves as an inspiration and an example to all those who look to us with confidence and hope . I come to this community in the closing days of a long campaign .	They do n't care , and I 'll prove it . We have a bill which does it the American way , not one that would have compulsory health insurance that would reduce the standard of medical care , that would compel millions of people who do n't want it and did n't need it to have it , but , one , a bill in which every American over 65 who wanted health insurance can get it , either private or Government , but in which no one in this country is compelled to have it against his will . That 's the American way of handling this problem .	Kennedy_October_30_1960	Nixon_October_29_1960

Mr. Nixon and the Republicans have stood against the progress since time began , and I believe in 1960 , in Michigan , which knows the significance of this election , I believe in Michigan and the United States , they are not going to entrust leadership to a candidate and a party that looks to the past .	Meanwhile , the contradictory statements of Senator Kennedy still leave him opposed to this position . The misstatement : In the second debate Senator Kennedy said : The Republicans in recent years , not only in the last 25 years , but in the last 8 years , have opposed * * * minimum wage * * The facts : Senator Kennedy is saying that Republicans who opposed his particular bill are against minimum wage .

There is your choice , the choice at home of going forward or back , of building on the great progress that we have made - building toward better schools , better hospitals , better medical care for our older people - of providing all the good things of life , but doing it through allowing Americans to do everything they can for themselves and Government doing everything that people will not do for themselves ; and in the foreign field , a choice between experience and known qualities , and inexperience and the chance that a mistake , out of the best of intentions , could set off the disaster that we do not want .

The point is : the Soviet Union is blocking the road to disarmament , blocking the road to stopping tests .	Only the President can overcome the frictions and differences between those agencies ; only he can weld all the parts of the Executive into a singleness of purpose in the pursuit of peace , and only the President can make the hard decisions , decisions involving peace or war , destruction or survival , which peace programs as well as war programs will surely bring .

Thirdly , I would hope that the United States could make for effective judgments of the events that are going to occur .	As President Eisenhower has said , the United States wants disarmament . We are willing to make all kinds of proposals for disarmament , but we are never going to disarm unless we are sure that the Soviet Union is also disarming at the same time through inspection , because if we did we would not be serving the cause of disarmament or of peace . We would be limiting our power at a time that the only one that threatens the peace of the world would be maintaining an advantage and gaining one that he did not previously have .

All through the campaign my opponent has been trumpeting the falsehood that I , in effect , feast on human misery - that I oppose minimum wage , help to distressed areas , social security , medical care for the aged , and all else that concerns the good of the American people . Last week Mr. Kennedy called me the leader of the social security wrecking crew - trying to secure votes from the aged by playing on their fears .	I want to ask them three questions . They talk about prosperity : No.1, Mr. Nixon says $ 1.25 a hour minimum wage is extreme . Ninety percent of the Republicans voted against it .	Nixon_November_3_1960	Kennedy_October_31_1960
0653	unemployment	attack	But both of them lived many , many years longer , and both of them , the longer they lived , gained love and affection from the American people - and I would only hope tonight that , however this election turns out , Senator Kennedy and I in the years ahead will be able to conduct ourselves with the dignity , the decency which earned the esteem and the love of the American people for the two men who were engaged in that great campaign of 1928 . The decline in unemployment throughout the country reported last week by the Departments of Labor and Commerce is good news for America . It must have come as a disappointing surprise to the opposition camp from which we are hearing so much foreboding talk about the future these days .	That problem , for America , has been solved . What have not been solved are those problems which lie largely in the realm of public action - bad housing , poverty , recessions , unemployment , discrimination , crowded and obsolete schools and hospitals and libraries , inadequate recreation , the breakdown of mass transportation , polluted air and water , juvenile delinquency . These problems are compounded as we become more and more an urban nation .	Nixon_October_19_1960	Kennedy_October_10_1960
0654	disarmament	attack	We can be proud that we are working through the United Nations to maintain the freedom of these people rather than to take it away . It 's true that President Eisenhower is n't making a fool of himself on the floor of the U.N. It 's true that he is advocating a program for disarmament , for the use of outer space , a program in addition , for the use of our surpluses through the United Nations . All of these are honest , decent proposals , which the whole world applauds .	And what has the United States been doing in the same 12 months ? We have frustrated congressional attempts to build more missiles , to harden our missile bases , to increase our powerful submarine fleet . We have failed to propose a consistent , comprehensive and workable plan for disarmament that would gain the support , at least , of the free world , based on careful preparation and technical studies . And we have been repeatedly reassured by Mr. Nixon - in glowing , sugar-coated terms that we have nothing to worry about in arms , science and space - that we have achieved peace without surrender - that statistics which show that the Russian economy is expanding faster than ours are dismissed as  growthmanship  - and that anti-American riots in Latin America and Japan were actually indications that the Communists were afraid to face us .	Nixon_October_3_1960	Kennedy_September_29_1960
0656	unemployment	attack	They are not the goals of his party , and Mr. Nixon and his party have opposed and killed every one of these programs . And their opposition - an opposition born of indifference to the urgent needs of the American people - has helped transform the Duluth - Superior area into a section of declining income , and increasing unemployment . But northern Minnesota has not been the only area to suffer .	These are programs for which I stand . Also , we believe in programs which would deal with the problems of unemployment more effectively . Programs which will deal with the problems of the depressed areas .	Kennedy_October_2_1960	Nixon_October_1_1960
0657	unemployment	attack	Put your thumb down regardless of what you do . We are fighting a candidate , the Republican Party , that for 20 years has opposed what the people need , minimum wage , housing , unemployment compensation . The real issue is which party and which candidate can best strengthen the United States , can best serve the public interest .	Listening to the opposition , one would never know that there are almost 68 million Americans at work in our $ 500 billion economy and that Americans are earning at a record annual rate of over $ 408 billion . One will never learn from my opponent that employment declined less than seasonally last month and that unemployment went down more than seasonally . Unemployment dropped not only as to number but also as a percentage of the labor force .	Kennedy_October_20_1960	Nixon_October_19_1960
0658	cuba	no_relation	I say in that connection that with all the criticism of President Eisenhower 's administration , they ca n't take away the solid fact that under his leadership we got the United States out of one war ; we 've kept her out of other wars , and we do have peace without surrender today . Yes , there are problems , problems like the one in Cuba that my opponent is discussing tonight without offering any solution for , and , incidentally , may I say , looking at that problem , I will have more to say about that at a later time , and he had better look to the record of his administration before he starts criticizing ours in that field . He talks about dictators , and I can only say that the number of dictators we inherited from the Truman administration is far greater than the number we have today in Latin America , and that 's something he must remember .	Only 90 miles away stood the United States - their good neighbor - the richest Nation on earth - its radios and newspapers and movies spreading the story of America 's material wealth and surplus crops . But instead of holding out a helping hand of friendship to the desperate people of Cuba , nearly all our aid was in the form of weapons assistance - assistance which merely strengthened the Batista dictatorship - assistance which completely failed to advance the economic welfare of the Cuban people - assistance which enabled Castro and the Communists to encourage the growing belief that America was indifferent to Cuban aspirations for a decent life . This year Mr. Nixon admitted that if we had formulated a program of Latin American economic development 5 years ago :  It might have produced economic progress in Cuba which might have averted the Castro takeover .

The Republican administration recommended and supported a new medical care program for dependents of members of the armed services . Under a Republican administration , a sound health program for American Indians was initiated .	, or Boston , Mass . This campaign is a fight for all those programs which Franklin Roosevelt fought for in his time , medical care for the aged tied to social security . Mr. Nixon says that is extreme .

If you believe that the area redevelopment bill , which has been vetoed twice , which would mean so much to this community and other communities , which are hard hit by chronic unemployment , and you want it vetoed a third time , you should vote for Mr. Nixon .	Thomas Jefferson has often made the point that the greatest guarantee of freedom is to diffuse power and that we must not have concentration of power in an all-powerful Federal Government , and it is because we believe that any kind of program that would put immense power in the Federal Government over our school system is something that Americans should reject , not because of the amount of money that is being spent , but because this kind of power is something which , in the wrong hands , would be something that all Americans would be against . Let me give you one other example in the program of medical care for the aged . We all want better health care for our older citizens .	Kennedy_October_4_1960	Nixon_October_3_1960
0662	disarmament	no_relation	We hurt it , because - why is America the guardian of peace today ? Because we 're the strongest nation in the world , and the difference is : We do n't want to use our strength for anything except to keep the peace . We do n't want anything from anybody else , but remember this : The moment the men in the Kremlin ever have more strength than we have , the moment we ever enter into a disarmament agreement , which would not have ironclad inspection , in which they would gain strength against us , we find that the enemies of peace then , the men in the Kremlin , are in a position where they can do what they want , and that is : They would use their strength to start war . They would use it because their aim is to conquer the world .	We must plan for the orderly reallocation of these resources to our peacetime needs . I do not share the opinion of some that disarmament would bring economic disaster . I believe that America can fruitfully use all our present productive power and much more to meet our vital needs for schools and roads and power and all the rest as well as our commitments to the war against poverty and Communist subversion abroad .

His pessimistic talk today recalls to my mind the situation in 1953 when the Eisenhower administration assumed responsibility for the Nation 's affairs .	I do not agree - and the Democratic Party has never agreed . Unemployment is not inisignificant to the almost 4 million Americans who want to work , but who ca n't find work - almost a quarter of a million of them in Michigan alone - or to the almost 900,000 Americans who have been out of work for more than 15 weeks and who are now classified as  long-term unemployed .  Unemployment is not insignificant to the families of the unemployed - families who are forced to live in substandard homes and are unable to maintain even a subsistence of living in the richest country on earth .

0665	minimum wage	no_relation	Previous to the convention we had passed housing , aid to education . After the convention , we did pass a minimum wage bill of $ 1.25 in the Senate . We failed by five votes on medical care for the aged tied to social security .	I think , as you are aware , you actually have three bills which are potentially before the Congress . You have the Kennedy bill , which would raise the minimum wage on a graduated basis to a dollar and a quarter in 3 years , and which would expand coverage to 5 million people not presently covered . You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase .

0666	disarmament	support	Such an effort requires not only long-term development loans but education , student exchanges , stepped up Voice of America broadcasts , concerned and competent Ambassadors , and a wide range of measures designed to increase the strength of freedom and stimulate the economic advance on which freedom often depends . Fourth , we will strengthen our planning the preparation for disarmament . One of the most glaring failures of the past 8 years has been our failure to prepare properly for any arms control conference since the end of the Korean war .	If we ever have disarmament in this world , disarmament without inspection , in which the strength of the Soviet Union relative to that of the United States is increased , the risk of war increases . In other words , disarmament without inspection increases the risk of war . It 's only disarmament with inspection that will reduce the risk of war .	Kennedy_November_7_1960	Nixon_November_3_1960
0667	medical care,health care	attack	We 're going to have to have more in the field of education . We 're going to have to have a better program in the field of medical care , but my friends , the reason why my programs are better for America than those of my opponent is this . That his would turn all of these problems over to the Federal Government , they would cost an amount equal - get this - each year to almost the entire gold reserve of America that 's in Fort Knox , and do you know what that means to you ? It means higher prices , higher taxes for the American people .	The fact of the matter is , as Congressman Flood knows , that the party that voted 90 percent against the $ 1.25 minimum wage voted 90 percent in the midthirties against 25 cents . The party that voted against medical care for the aged , 90 percent in 1960 , voted 90 percent against the social security in the midthirties . You have to make your judgment .

Unemployment is not insignificant to the families of the unemployed - families who are forced to live in substandard homes and are unable to maintain even a subsistence of living in the richest country on earth . Unemployment is not insignificant to the children of the unemployed who are deprived of decent clothing and a decent diet .	Have you ever talked to a Negro mother as I have ? Have you ever heard her tell you , try to explain to a child in the South ? How do you explain that she can go into a store and buy a loaf of bread but ca n't sit at the counter and have a Coca - Cola ? This makes you understand that it is n't enough just to pass laws ; it is n't enough just to make speeches , but what you have to do is do what the Attorney General of the United States must do , not just a lot of promises and talk , but get in the leaders of chainstores and get them to agree to break down this barrier so that we can remove this block from the people of this country and our Nation . What about unemployment ? How can you believe me when I say I will move this economy forward , that we will use all the power of this Government to fight unemployment , to fight recession ; but , more than that , we 're going to use it in a positive way to stimulate employment , to open new avenues for expansion of economy ? How do you know ? How can you believe me ? I 'll tell you why . Because I know what it means .	Kennedy_October_14_1960	Nixon_October_5_1960
0670	cuba	no_relation	Thus far these fighters for freedom have had virtually no support from our Government .  This clearly means , as the New York Times Washington correspondent , James Reston , reported in today 's paper :  His statement this week on Cuba , publicly calling for Government aid to overthrow Castro , is a clear violation of the inter-American treaty prohibition against intervention in the internal affairs of the hemisphere Republics .  Thus it is clear that you and I are diametrically opposed on a matter of great public interest and one which the next President may have to deal with as soon as he assumes the office .	I can not understand , however , why you wish to place a gag on the press in this final debate . Cuba is important but so are our relations with the Soviet Union , the problems of Latin America , Africa , and Asia . Equally important are the domestic issues which you and the Republican Party seem to wish to bury during this campaign - minimum wage , medical care for the aged , aid to education , and the rising rate of unemployment ; only a week ago you stated you were going to talk about Quemoy and Matsu every day for the final 3 weeks of the campaign .	Nixon_October_23_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
0671	minimum wage	attack	The Republican program in education , unlike Mr. Kennedy 's would provide funds for school construction which would enable State and local districts to use their money for raising teachers salaries , without involving the Government in the direct payment of teachers salaries which would lead toward dictation from Washington as to what is taught in our schools to our children . It is a matter of record that Republicans have extended social security and strengthened minimum wage legislation . Moreover , we care too much for people to advocate programs , as my opponent does , which would raise Federal spending by over $ 15 billion a year - programs so great they could be paid for , not out of miracles of economic growth , but by 180 million Americans in higher taxes and higher prices .	[ Laughter . ] He voted as a Congressman in 1949 to take 1 million people out from under the coverage of the Minimum Wage Act . Mr. Nixon and the Republicans have stood against the progress since time began , and I believe in 1960 , in Michigan , which knows the significance of this election , I believe in Michigan and the United States , they are not going to entrust leadership to a candidate and a party that looks to the past .	Nixon_October_29_1960	Kennedy_October_26_1960
0672	medical care,health care	attack	We need development of our natural resources . We need to provide education for our children , jobs for our people , medical care for our aged tied to social security . We need to do all these things in a country and in a society that is on the move .	[ Cheers and applause . ] And that is why we have a program for medical care for the aged , a program which will provide that all of our citizens over 55 who want health insurance will be able to get it , will have a choice , but that no one who does not want it will be forced to have it against his will . That is the American way to do this .	Kennedy_November_6_1960	Nixon_November_5_1960
0673	disarmament	no_relation	Halt the arms race .  Let me tell you about disarmament . When people say ,  I 'm for disarmament ,  and when some people write to me and say  Why , when Mr. Khrushchev comes over and says he 's for total disarmament - why do we have to insist on inspection ? Why ,  they say ,  could n't we just do it ? Would n't that be real leadership in the world ? Would n't that be bold and imaginative ?  Yes , it would ; but do you know what would happen ? The moment the United States ever enters into an agreement for disarmament , which would result in increasing his strength as against ours , we do n't help the cause of peace .	Perhaps they will not agree to the effective system of inspection and control which is vital to agreement . Perhaps the Communist Chinese will refuse to participate in arms control negotiation , even though their ultimate participation is essential to effective disarmament . Perhaps the science of inspection will be unable to keep pace with advancing weapons technology .	Nixon_October_25_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
0674	medical care,health care	no_relation	But I know that in this country there are literally hundreds of thousands of people and also hundreds of thousands of children whose parents are in this situation , who are confronted with catastrophic illnesses and wonder what can be done . Now what can be done ? Here 's my answer : I say that in this field we want first to be sure that we maintain what we have today , and you know what it is ? The best medical care in the world . We do n't want to do anything that reduces the standard of our medical care .	That is the same party that voted 90 percent against 25 cents minimum wage . I do n't lead a party which voted 90 percent against social security , which ran a presidential candidate , Alf Landon , in 1936 , calling for the repeal of social security , and yet that is the same party in 1960 that voted against medical care for the aged . I think the record tells us something .	Nixon_October_12_1960	Kennedy_October_12_1960
0675	disarmament	support	The hope for peace is to be firm against those who threaten the peace so that they ca n't blackmail us . The hope for peace is then to go out and sit down , from a position of strength , and negotiate for disarmament for peace but always from strength and never from weakness . And that 's what Cabot Lodge and I will do .	And if we let the nations of Africa and Asia and Latin America feel that the United States is the real obstacle to disarmament , that we are not sincere in our desire for peace - if we continue to let the Soviet Union seize the offensive in disarmament negotiations - then these emerging areas of the world may well turn away from America and the free world , and begin to look to the Communist bloc for leadership in the fight for peace . And , of course , we must also seek disarmament because the only alternative to pursuit of an effective disarmament agreement is the pursuit of our present course - the arms race , the gap , new weapons , the development of even higher orders of mutual terror resulting in the ever higher likelihood of mutual destruction . But we will not move toward disarmament and a secure peace , we will not be any closer to freedom from fear , if we simply follow Mr. Nixon 's plan for meetings , more conferences , more study groups and discussions .	Nixon_October_28_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
0679	minimum wage	attack	I believe the American people prefer their experience under the Democratic Party . Our experience is written in the Social Security Act , the minimum wage laws , the FHA , the REA , guaranteed bank deposits , TVA and a host of other programs . The Bible tells us that  whatsoever a man soweth , that shall he also reap .	The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve . In 1960 , this administration sought to extend minimum wage coverage to 3.1 million additional workers and indicated support of an increase in the minimum wage to $ 1.15 per hour . The misstatement : In the first debate Senator Kennedy said that the Republican Party gives only  lipservice  to programs of medical care for the aged .	Kennedy_October_24_1960	Nixon_October_19_1960
0681	cuba	no_relation	Secondly , how is it possible for the United States and the Soviet Union and France and Britain to come to a conclusion to cease nuclear testing with some worthwhile inspection system ? How is it possible for us , who initiated the first atomic advance - how is it possible for us to make a decisive breakthrough in this area ? Because of experiments now going on in Western Germany , it appears likely that almost 20 countries will have an atomic capacity by 1965 . China , Egypt , Cuba - all the rest of them , all possessing atomic weapons , all possessing a hydrogen capacity perhaps all possessing ballistic missiles , and the means of delivering them . When we realize that war has been the constant companion of mankind through the ages , we are about to move into a period of history when any country or combination of countries can destroy themselves , their adversaries , and perhaps the human race , all in the next 10 years .	It 's been done , incidentally , over the objection of some well-intentioned , but hopelessly naive Castro apologists within the United States - and all that I can say with regard to Senator Kennedy 's position is that he apparently is attempting to obscure his association with the views of this pro-Castro group as indicated in the book that I mentioned a moment ago or he must have thought now that there would be political advantage in taking a stronger position than I have taken , a radical position , instead of the strong and sound position that the administration has taken . And , so , what does he suggest ? He comes up , as I pointed up , with the fantastic recommendation that the U.S. Government shall directly aid the anti-Castro forces both in and out of Cuba . Now , every freedom-loving person in the United States - let 's make it clear - is in sympathy with the democratic anti-Castro forces in Cuba and outside Cuba .	Kennedy_October_23_1960	Nixon_October_22_1960
0682	disarmament	attack	And you ask about prestige . What do our opponents think ? Do they think that Mr. Khrushchev gains prestige for the Communists when he takes off his shoe at the United Nations and pounds the table with it ? I say no. I say that President Eisenhower gained prestige for America when with great dignity and great responsibility , he stood for peace , for disarmament , for all the things that Americans believe in. No , my friends , the real test of prestige , if our prestige was low , I can assure you , would occur in the United Nations , and there what do we find ? In every instance where we 've had a test vote - and listen to this - in the last 7 years , with the Soviet Union on one side and the United States on the other , we have won ; and in the vote on the Congo we won , 70 to nothing . My friends , that 's a pretty good score in football .	Yet in the past 8 years , and in my opinion this is one of the most serious indictments that can be leveled against this administration , in this vital area in the past 8 years this administration has given this problem no attention . In the entire U.S. Government we have had fewer than 100 people working on the complex subject of arms control and disarmament , less than 100 people , scattered through four or five agencies of the Government . When I reminded Mr. Nixon of this in one of the debates he gave one of his usual answers .	Nixon_October_26_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
0683	disarmament	attack	And I say that we can not and should not blame ourselves , our policies , our negotiators , their scientific advisers , or their instructions , for the unyielding refusal of the Soviets to make an agreement at Geneva . The time and patience which we have already expended to explore this way out of the disarmament dilemma have been full proof of our own intentions and those of the Soviets . The blame rests squarely on them .	And by that time our chief negotiator had been repudiated by the administration , and publicly demoted from the White House staff . At the next important disarmament conference , the 1958 Geneva Conference on surprise attack , we were represented by a businessman who had been out of Government for 5 years , and who had assumed his duties only 5 weeks before the conference met . Almost up to the opening day of the meeting , we had prepared no position , conducted no special research , formulated no realistic or constructive proposals .

0684	unemployment	no_relation	Once again the economy surged to levels that they so like to cite . So what judgment is to be made of the opposition 's 20-year stewardship of the Nation 's economic affairs ? 1. Its policy was a tragic failure in solving the problem of unemployment during the peacetime years from 1933 to 1939 . 2. During the following 6 years , preparation for war and war itself solved the unemployment problem for them .	There are a billion more people crowding our globe , and every American can hear the rumbling of a distant drum . The next President will have a budget 25 times as large as that of the candidates in Al Smith 's time , and he will face problems unprecedented in that time or in any time in our long history , automation and unemployment , farm surpluses and food shortages , a high cost of living in the midst of an economic slump , new nations , new leaders , the world is different across the street and on the other side of the moon . The white race is in the minority , the free-enterprise system is in the minority , and the majority are looking at us harder and longer than they ever looked before .	Nixon_October_19_1960	Kennedy_October_19_1960
0685	unemployment	attack	Consider their whole 20-year record . For 6 years in the 1930 's the opposition failed miserably to solve the problem of unemployment . In 1939 , when war came in Europe , unemployment in America , after 6 futile years of their trying to solve it , stood just under 9 ½ million .	And unemployment is not insignificant to the Democratic Party - which has always pursued a policy of full employment - which has never said that there  must be some unemployment  and which is going to see that there are jobs for all Americans in the sixties . In fact , unemployment is only insignificant to Mr. Nixon and a Republican Party which has opposed every Democratic effort to put men back to work in the past 8 years - which has complacently stood by while unemployment rose from less than 2 million in 1952 to 4 million today and while Michigan lost more than 100,000 jobs despite an expanding population . For I believe that the American people are going to reject a party which - again in Mr. Nixon 's words - believes that  unemployment is inevitable ,  a party which lacks faith in the capacity of a strong and growing America to provide jobs for all its people , a party which , in the most fundamental sense , is letting America run down because it is failing to build America up , a party whose candidate is all too ready to threaten war but is unwilling to build up the strength which is the only guarantee of peace , who is always willing to speak loudly , but is unwilling to be sure that America carries a big stick .

I do n't worry about the cause of freedom , I do n't worry about our prestige around the world , our influence around the globe , as long as we are moving here at home .	And then came a third test , and this a very difficult one . Here we had a little  pipsqueak  dictator , Castro , down in Cuba . The question is not who is against Castro .

0687	medical care,health care	attack	Now , a lot of people , l know , could well raise the question as to whether there are other things that are more important as far as this election campaign is concerned than programs that will keep the peace and extend freedom and keep freedom in this country . And I certainly would reply by saying that other things also are very important : We want better schools in America ; we want better health care in America available to all of our citizens ; we want better jobs for our people ; we also want to see the income of our farm families participate in the tremendously increasing prosperity which Americans are enjoying . But , above all , my friends , we want to see these young people , these schoolchildren who by the thousands we have seen along the streets of these Iowa towns and cities today , and who are here by the thousands , we want to see that they grow up to enjoy all these other good things - that they do have a life of peace for themselves and for the world .	But because the magnitude of this problem is increasing , it has reached a point where Government help is needed - and needed badly . In the last session of Congress we Democrats tried to enact a bill to provide for decent medical care for our older citizens under social security . It was a moderate bill .

0689	cuba	no_relation	As a matter of fact , this talk about the fact that Cuba is lost and that Ghana is lost , and Guinea is lost , incidentally - and they have also claimed that - is irresponsible in the extreme . Cuba is not lost . The fact that Castro , of course , is following a pro-Communist line at the present time causes us great concern , but there are plenty of things that we can do and are doing , and we 're taking some very firm steps , as you know , to quarantine Castro in that area .	For example , while in August of 1958 we sent $ 42 million worth of goods to Cuba - this August we sent only $ 18 million worth as a result of Castro 's deliberate policy of cutting American exports . And , as the New York Times points out this morning , the goods which are now cut off , are the very goods whose export has been declining - while the goods which Cuba can still buy - such as foodstuffs and pharmaceuticals - are the goods whose export has declined relatively little . In addition , the State Department admits that Castro has refused to pay for about one-quarter of the American goods he has received since coming into power .

0691	cuba	no_relation	That is the great force working for us . The seed it planted and ultimately is going to reap the harvest the desire of people to be independent whether they live in Congo or Cuba or Russia or Poland or East Germany . Sooner or later the basic desire to run their own affairs , to be free men and women , I think represents the most powerful force that this country has .	They feel we were correct , I think , the majority of them , in acting as we did with regard to the sugar , the taking away of special consideration that we had with regard to sugar . They thought that was justified in view of the Cuban Government 's expropriation of much of our property , but I think our present course in Cuba has not lost us friends in Latin America . If anything , it has gained us friends .	Kennedy_September_22_1960	Nixon_September_21_1960

A good many of our membership are very much concerned about the growth of unemployment throughout this State and throughout the Nation .

Here 's what you do : First , you look at our record and on the record I say you compare the record of the Eisenhower administration with the record of the administration which preceded it . Both have been in for 7 ½ years , and you can take any test you want - schools , housing , medical care , jobs , wages , controlling inflation - and you will find that in this administration we have moved forward ; we have had far greater progress than in the Truman administration . And , so , your choice is : If you want to go back to what we left , you have an easy choice because that 's what our opponents offer .	[ Applause . ] And I could not leave here today , this great source of national strength here in Warm Springs , without reminding all of us that there is still unfinished business before us in the health field , that there are still over 18 million Americans over the age of 65 who live out their lives without assistance , without a recognition of the great problems that they face in the field of health , and I believe it incumbent upon the next Congress and the next administration to permit them to participate in the development of a trust fund which will provide protection in their old age without their having to take , as they now take , a pauper 's oath before they can receive medical assistance and medical care . [ Applause .	Nixon_October_10_1960	Kennedy_October_10_1960
0696	unemployment	no_relation	One in particular is with regard to unemployment compensation . I think that unemployment compensation - our unemployment compensation principles and programs - should be revised , so that we can have a more effective method . That means longer periods which the unemployment compensation covers and also standards which are more general throughout the States , so that you can have a greater cushion during a recession than we presently have .	He charged that we Republicans were indifferent , indifferent to the problems of unemployment and distress in West Virginia . Now , first , about indifference : I know what unemployment is . I have seen people come into my Dad 's store when they were unemployed and wanted a job and have to put things on the books , and I know the shame in their faces , and I know how difficult it was for the children who were in school with whom I went .

How are they going to get by and find homes , shelter , and medical care ? These are the problems that the United States must face . I am delighted to discuss any problems that anyone wants to raise in this campaign , but I want to turn Mr. Nixon 's attention not only to the coast of China but to the United States and New Jersey and the problems it faces and our people face .	But the record is written in the Congress , day in and day out . On medical care for the aged tied to social security , which would cost 3 cents a day per person , an average of $ 12 a year it would insure any person retiring that they would receive medical care , nursing care , the cost of their medicine . Now , under the bill which the President signed , if you get sick and you are retired , and you have saved up $ 500 or $ 800 , you have to first exhaust all of that for medical bills , then you take a pauper 's oath that you are medically indigent .

First , he may have some new proposals on disarmament which he hopes to capture the attention of the world with . Second I think he thinks that the General Assembly of the United Nations is going to be increasingly influential and powerful .	I think that we have many arms in the arsenal , and one of course is that , and we should keep that second to none . Secondly , I hope that we can try to work out with our adversaries , the Communists , a realistic system with inspection for the lessening of arms tension , for the cessation of nuclear tests and for the beginning of disarmament , and lift that heavy burden from us all . Thirdly , I think that we should assist those countries to the south of us who are attempting to solve their staggering economic problems and help them join with us .

We are going to have to provide medical care for the aged tied to social security , because all the people are entitled to live out their lives in some kind of dignity , and we are going to have to provide equality of opportunity for all Americans . Now , you have to decide which party and which candidate based on their history , based on their statements in this campaign , based on their look into the future , can lead this country into the dangerous years of the 1960 's , which party and which candidate and which viewpoint can build in this country a strong society which will serve as an inspiration to the people around the world .	[ Laughter . ] But this administration , the same administration that voted 90 percent against social security in the midthirties , voted 95 percent against the medical care for the aged tied to social security . If there is anyone here who has a mother or father who is over 65 , if they get sick and they are living with you , do you know before they can get medical assistance under the program signed by the President , you have to prove that they are medically indigent ? They have to sign an oath , a pauper 's oath , that they have n't any money , nor you , and then they can get assistance .	Kennedy_October_27_1960	Kennedy_October_26_1960

Minimum wage , housing , unemployment compensation , and in the last session of the Congress in August , when we brought up a bill for medical care for the aged , we received 45 Democrats and 1 Republican who supported it , and we were told it would be vetoed if it passed . I want to say right here that that bill must pass next year , and there will be a President , we hope , in the White house who will not veto it but encourage it .	To pass them by - to water down the help they need - or merely assume that prosperity at the top will someday reach them - shocks the conscience of those who care . The increases in purchasing power resulting from a higher minimum wage will help to restore consumer demand required to put our idle industrial capacity back to work .

I ask you to join us in 1960 .	The Democratic Party has opposed in the past and will just as strongly oppose in the future the attempts to weaken the Railway Labor Act .

Mr. Nixon himself was in Latin America 5 years ago and here is what he said :  If we had produced economic progress in Cuba we might have averted the Cuban takeover .  Why did n't we ? That is what he said a month ago ; why did n't we in 1955 come forward with a program that would have prevented Castro from taking power ? When he was there in 1955 , he said , and you can judge his experience ,  I am convinced that communism has passed its highwater mark in Latin America ,  at a time when the Communists were about to communize Cuba .	[ Applause . ] Only if we are strong as a nation - strong economically , strong militarily , strong educationally , strong in heart and purpose - can we assure our peace and security in an age where our enemies are overtaking us in missile power , are far surpassing us in broadcasts abroad , have penetrated for the first time into the Middle East and Africa , have outshone our efforts in science and space , and have rolled the Iron Curtain to 90 miles from our shores onto the once friendly island of Cuba .

0708	disarmament	support	We have to have the power because we are friends of peace . As long as America is the strongest nation in the world , the world need not fear that there will be war , because we will use our strength to keep peace , and I think that all of you , including those who are as dedicated to peace as I am , will say that we want the next President of the United States always to go the extra mile , as President Eisenhower has , to negotiate with Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else for disarmament . We want to go the extra mile to strengthen the United Nations and the instruments of peace , but under no circumstances do we want the next President to be a man who will be fooled , who will make concessions to them without getting concessions in return , and , above all , we do not want the next President to be one who will reduce the strength of America unless we 're absolutely sure that the enemies of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time .	I want to explain that in terms of examples today because it seems to me there has been a great lack of understanding in recent months , and , for that matter in recent years , as to why the United States has followed the line that it has diplomatically . People have often spoken to me and they have said ,  Why ca n't we be more flexible in our dealings on disarmament ? Why ca n't we find a bold new program in this area which will make it possible for the Soviet Union to agree ?  And the answer is , of course , that the United States has gone the extra mile in disarmament time and time again . The answer is that the reason the Soviet Union has not agreed is that they do not want apparently to disarm unless we give up the right to inspection .	Nixon_October_22_1960	Nixon_October_18_1960

[ Applause .	The bill has two major purposes . First , it will raise the minimum wage now received by 2 1/2 million workers from $ 1.10 to $ 1.25 an hour .

0712	unemployment	support	 But Mr. Nixon and the party he leads say they are content , just as they have always been content , in the face of poverty and unemployment and an America with its most urgent needs unmet . The Republican Party which Mr. Nixon leads today is the same Republican Party which for half a century has opposed every single progressive measure which the Democrats have designed to improve human welfare and reduce human misery - the party which fought against the New Deal and tried to block the Fair Deal - the party which , in the past 8 years , has vetoed aid to areas of unemployment , blocked efforts to improve unemployment compensation , opposed raising the minimum wage , refused to expand the distribution of surplus food to the hungry , and failed to offer one single program to increase the welfare of the American people . But Americans will not forget Mr. Nixon 's party this November - and they will return the Democrats to leadership so that all Americans can share in American abundance .	The raising of the minimum wage and its extension to cover millions of unprotected American workers must be one of the first items on the agenda of the next administration . Our unemployment benefits , too , must be standardized and extended . By assuring working Americans of a living wage , by assuring unemployed Americans that they will be able to have the basic necessities of life , we help not only New England against substandard competition ; we help the entire Nation .

We need to enact Federal standards of unemployment compensation so that jobless men can receive benefits adequate to allow them to obtain at least the basic rudiments of existence . We need to offer a richer and more varied diet to those forced to live on surplus foods .	For this is not the same Nation as it was in 1952 . Automation was little more than a word then - now it means unemployment and hardship for untold thousands of workers . The pressure on our schools - the plight of our elderly - the cost-price squeeze on our farmers - the decline of our cities - the high cost of medical care - these are newer and greater problems and pressures which in 1960 are still growing and changing and demanding new leadership .

The kind of a meeting that we had today indicates , I think , that partnership which can exist between the farmers of this country and the Federal Government . Senator John F. Kennedy tonight expressed keen disappointment on the defeat of the Anderson - Kennedy amendment to the medical care to the aged bill .

He promises to impose a mandatory medical care plan for the aged on every one of the millions of citizens covered by social security , no matter what their personal desires , and leave 3 million Americans with no medical care program at all . My plan would not be compulsory and would provide medical care programs for all those who needed and wanted them .	It is very easy to talk about all the programs you 're for , but when they had the opportunity , as they have had the opportunity during these past years , they were not able to move forward in these areas in which they have talked . Now , let 's look at some of these programs , and particularly one that will be of great interest to this audience here , the program of medical care for the aged . We stand for a program which recognizes this program , recognizes it because we know that all of our families in this country want to see to it that our older citizens not only are well cared for , but that they have the opportunity to get care particularly when illnesses of serious nature strike .

Earlier this month , I reviewed the sorry story of how under our very noses , and in part as the result of our own policies - Cuba had moved from a position of good neighbor to a position of bitter enemy .	But Mr. Nixon did n't say a word that was ever publicly recorded . Even more incredible , he did n't say a word when the Communists took power in Cuba - not 4 miles off their shores , but only 90 miles off our shores . Mr. Nixon saw what was happening in Cuba .

0725	disarmament	no_relation	The struggle for disarmament will not be an easy one . For disarmament is an ideal just as peace itself is an ideal , but it was a great son of Wisconsin , Carl Schurz , who said : Ideals are like stars ; you will not succeed in touching them with your hands . But , like the seafaring man on the desert of waters , you choose them as your guides , and following them you will reach your destiny .	He criticized administration farm vetoes . He stressed , and I quote him ,  The necessity for the restoration of cordial relations with Latin America  and he called for more effective action against disarmament .

This summer , when we tried to improve the standards of social security by providing medical care for the aged tied to social security , again the great majority of the Republicans , over 90 percent , voted against medical care for the aged tied to social security .	It is the kind of problem that is difficult of solution , but it is the kind of problem that the Republicans never think about . They have never concerned themselves in the last 25 years with the problems of employment , of social security , of housing , of minimum wage , of social justice , of equality of treatment , of aid to education , of a stronger better America , to which we are committed .

A man less wise , a man less firm , could have made the fatal error that would have resulted in war or surrender . After having seen what is required , and also after having been around the world and having seen in the Kremlin the tough , ruthless men that confront us ; my friends , I know we can not afford to take a chance on someone who would be inconsistent , someone who would suggest , as my opponent did , that President Eisenhower could have apologized to Mr. Khrushchev at Paris - he could n't do that - someone who would have sliced off a piece of the free world , someone who would have sliced it off at Quemoy and Matsu , doing the very thing that resulted in war in Korea - we ca n't have a man who would have made that kind of mistake - someone who would have made the critical error on Cuba that he would have made in our debate the other day , an error that would have lost us all of our friends in Latin America .

0730	disarmament	support	I believe that this country can do more for peace than it has done . I am not satisfied to have only 100 experts scattered through the U.S. Government working on the sensitive and complex issue of disarmament . I regret that our negotiators at previous disarmament conferences too often have been ill prepared , ill advised , and ill staffed .	They are afraid of diplomatic policies that teeter on the brink of war . They are dismayed that our negotiators have no solid plans for disarmament . And they are discouraged by a philosophy that puts its faith in swapping threats and insults with the Russians .	Kennedy_September_16_1960	Kennedy_September_7_1960
0733	disarmament	support	As President Eisenhower has said , the United States wants disarmament . We are willing to make all kinds of proposals for disarmament , but we are never going to disarm unless we are sure that the Soviet Union is also disarming at the same time through inspection , because if we did we would not be serving the cause of disarmament or of peace . We would be limiting our power at a time that the only one that threatens the peace of the world would be maintaining an advantage and gaining one that he did not previously have .	I 'm confident of what America can do in the years ahead , provided that Americans know the problems , face up to the challenge , and stay true to the principles that have made this country great . Now , if I might turn to one other point that I think should be covered on an occasion like this , what should be our diplomatic policy in these years ahead ? Diplomatically , the United States , as the President indicated at Baltimore this morning , must always be ready and willing to sit down at the conference table and discuss disarmament , to discuss any differences that we have with any other nation in the world , because we must work for peace constantly ; but on the other hand , let 's remember , as the President also said this morning , when it comes to disarmament we must never forget that we can take nothing on faith , because America must never give up any of its own strength unless we know that the potential enemies of freedom and of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time . In other words , we can have disarmament only with inspection , with the guarantees which the President has insisted upon and which we will insist upon in the next administration as well .

In 1952 , during the campaign between Adlai Stevenson and Dwight Eisenhower , there was no discussion , really , of outer space , and yet this administration , when a similar opportunity was granted to it to make a significant breakthrough , to recognize the implications of the opportunity in the same way that Franklin Roosevelt had recognized it in 1941 , when this administration was informed of the significance of outer space , both militarily and scientifically , we did not respond . My judgment is that we did not respond there as we have not responded to our needs in Latin America , our needs in Africa , our needs in Asia , our needs in disarmament , our needs in arms , because this administration has not been able to attract people of intellectual vitality , curiosity , foresight , and vigor .

0738	minimum wage	no_relation	If the people 's interest is going to be protected , the President of the United States must stand for that protection . It is the President of the United States that can set the goals for the country in housing , minimum wage , social security , unemployment compensation , and in equality of rights for all Americans , regardless of their race or color . I stand in direct succession to Truman and Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson , who advanced the right of all Americans to participate equally in our society .	Four-fifths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives , including the Congressman of this district , who is chairman of the congressional committee for all Republicans , voted against the $ 1.25 minimum wage for a 40-hour week , not for a business which is only ten , fifteen , or twenty-five thousand dollars a year , but for a business which makes more than $ 1 million a year , we wanted to pay them $ 1.25 by 1962 , not this year , but 1962 , and to pay those that were not covered by 1964 $ 1.25 , and four-fifths of the Republicans voted against it . I think these issues are important , not because the minimum wage is maybe the most important issue in the United States today , and not because medical care for the aged itself may be the most important issue , and not because aid to education itself may be the most important issue . I think the most important issue is the security of the United States and the peace of the world .	Kennedy_October_3_1960	Kennedy_September_28_1960
0739	disarmament	no_relation	For the hopes of all mankind rest on successful disarmament . And if we let the nations of Africa and Asia and Latin America feel that the United States is the real obstacle to disarmament , that we are not sincere in our desire for peace - if we continue to let the Soviet Union seize the offensive in disarmament negotiations - then these emerging areas of the world may well turn away from America and the free world , and begin to look to the Communist bloc for leadership in the fight for peace . And , of course , we must also seek disarmament because the only alternative to pursuit of an effective disarmament agreement is the pursuit of our present course - the arms race , the gap , new weapons , the development of even higher orders of mutual terror resulting in the ever higher likelihood of mutual destruction .

Because remember this : If we ever have disarmament where we disarm and the other side does n't , that means that we increase the risk of war rather than reduce it , and we 're not going to do that and we can be sure of that .	Let me just make this one point . We will always go the extra mile to negotiate , We will always make over every proposal and take every initiative , as President Eisenhower did , on disarmament , on open skies , on the use of outer space for peaceful purposes in his U.N. speech . But , on the other hand , if we really want peace , my friends , the way to destroy our hopes is for the United States ever to agree to disarm when the Russians are n't also doing it .

But Mr. Nixon and the party he leads say they are content , just as they have always been content , in the face of poverty and unemployment and an America with its most urgent needs unmet . The Republican Party which Mr. Nixon leads today is the same Republican Party which for half a century has opposed every single progressive measure which the Democrats have designed to improve human welfare and reduce human misery - the party which fought against the New Deal and tried to block the Fair Deal - the party which , in the past 8 years , has vetoed aid to areas of unemployment , blocked efforts to improve unemployment compensation , opposed raising the minimum wage , refused to expand the distribution of surplus food to the hungry , and failed to offer one single program to increase the welfare of the American people .	We are not satisfied to have 16 million Americans living out their lives as senior citizens with an average social-security check of $ 78 a month . I am not satisfied as an American to have the average unemployment compensation check for an American out of work and seeking a job to be $ 31 a week in the richest country in the world . I am not satisfied to have the average for laundrywomen , and most of them are Negroes , in five large cities , to be 65 cents an hour for a 48-hour week .

You have to do something about it .	Now , if you regard those programs as extreme , I believe you should support Mr. Nixon and the Republican Party . But if you believe that you can not have a prosperous town in this State if your agricultural income continues to drop , if you recognize that under the program which Mr. Nixon put forward , which is a continuation of the Benson program , and corn which sold 8 years ago for $ 1.50 sells in this State at 95 cents today , will sell next year at 80 cents , and down and down it will go , because this administration 's farm program provides for a free market price , and the free market price for corn in this country with unlimited production will take that down at least 20 percent below what it is selling at today , and if any merchant in this State feels he can prosper with corn on the downward trend , with unemployment in this State , at 6.8 percent to 7 percent , any merchant in this country who feels he can move forward when steel production is at 50 percent of capacity , which it is in the United States , when 7 out of 8 International Harvester plants in Illinois closed down in the last 2 weeks , and they may open some of them in October - if that is the kind of country you want and that is the kind of economy you believe in , if those are the programs you want , I believe you should vote for Mr. Nixon . But if you believe it is time this country moved forward , if you believe we have stood on dead center long enough , if you believe that the balance of power in the world should shift in our direction instead of against us , if you believe that the United States should be first - not first but , if , sometimes or perhaps , but first , period .

0744	disarmament	support	A recent independent survey concludes , and I quote it accurately ,  The only continuous features of our efforts in the disarmament field have been a lack of continuity in top personnel and a paucity of planning and research effort .  As a result , we have been unprepared at every disarmament conference that we have attended . At a time when our relative military strength was at its height , in the mid fifties , at a time when we had the best chance to reach an agreement on control of arms , there was not a single top person in the entire Government working on this subject .	In 1952 , during the campaign between Adlai Stevenson and Dwight Eisenhower , there was no discussion , really , of outer space , and yet this administration , when a similar opportunity was granted to it to make a significant breakthrough , to recognize the implications of the opportunity in the same way that Franklin Roosevelt had recognized it in 1941 , when this administration was informed of the significance of outer space , both militarily and scientifically , we did not respond . My judgment is that we did not respond there as we have not responded to our needs in Latin America , our needs in Africa , our needs in Asia , our needs in disarmament , our needs in arms , because this administration has not been able to attract people of intellectual vitality , curiosity , foresight , and vigor .

Governor Nelson has taken an active role in formulating a dairy program .

I have confidence in an America able to afford the best schools and the best teachers in the world - an America where no one is denied his full constitutional rights by reason of his race or religion - an America where every family lives in a decent home in a decent neighborhood - an America where the cost of living is not completely beyond those who work for a living - particularly those receiving an inadequate minimum wage of $ 1 an hour . I have confidence that America is capable of operating at full capacity - that we could consume in new schools and hospitals and dams and highways the full output of our steel mills now operating at only half their capacity .

We 're proud that President Eisenhower spoke for the whole free world so eloquently in the United Nations - and he could have referred to that , I think . Maybe he was referring to the fact that Mr. Khrushchev spoke for 4 ½ hours in the United Nations , and again - I mean Mr. Castro , and he spoke for 4 ½ hours - Mr. Khrushchev could have spoken even longer , I know from experience ; but , be that as it may , whatever it is , Khrushchev speaks in the U.N., Castro speaks in the U.N. They say everything that is wrong about us , and everything is right about them ; but , my friends , they ca n't take away the fact that when President Eisenhower spoke the whole free world spoke with him , that when President Eisenhower spoke , he was not just talking - he was acting for the cause of peace , acting for the cause of freedom , standing for true disarmament , honest disarmament ; and , as the President has said to me many times , and this I pledge to you in the future , we will always go an extra mile to negotiate .

We know the right way , and our opponent offers a way which would have lost us our friends in Latin America - the tremendous outrage that they exploded with , once he made that very silly and foolish and immature suggestion of his that we ought to intervene directly in Cuba .

It would , as we have seen from the immediate response of shock and dismay in Latin America , alienate every one of our sister American Republics whose friendship you have acknowledged is of vital importance to our efforts against communism . 3.

0756	minimum wage	no_relation	I think it is a good question because it goes to the heart of the matter which I was trying to point to before . In the case of the minimum wage , we passed out of the Senate by a vote of nearly 2 to 1. That was the $ 1.25 minimum wage . Earlier , the House of Representatives passed a bill by , I think , nine votes against the $ 1.25 minimum wage , in favor of a wholly inadequate coverage under minimum wage which affected only about 1 million people .	The bill has two major purposes . First , it will raise the minimum wage now received by 2 1/2 million workers from $ 1.10 to $ 1.25 an hour . Second , it will extend the protection of the Fair Labor Standards Act to 5 million additional employees , chiefly in large-scale interstate retail and service industries , thereby guaranteeing these employees a fair minimum wage and a just premium for overtime .

Mr. Nixon 's contention that the hard-hit unemployment areas of the country would have received more help under the administration area redevelopment bill than under the Douglas - Flood bill , which I supported and which President Eisenhower vetoed , is patently absurd .

The task which faces you as a union is to adjust yourselves to these tremendous industrial changes which are going to bring white-collar workers where blue-collar workers once dominated . The problem for us as citizens of the United States , the problem for us , those of us who serve in the Government , in the Congress or in the executive branch , is how we can maintain full employment , how we can absorb the production of our industries , how we can provide for the orderly transition from present production methods into new production methods without displacing our workers , how we can in short in the steel industry , in the chemical industry , in the oil industry , in the newspaper industry , how we can provide labor-saving machinery at the same time maintaining full employment , at the same time making sure that those machines produce a better life rather than a life of unemployment for so many of our citizens .

Why is this necessary for peace ? Because , as I said at my last stop , we 've got to remember that as long as the United States maintains its present position of being stronger than anyone who threatens the peace of the world we can be the guardians of peace ; but the moment that somebody or some nation that does not want peace - in other words , that would use war as an instrument of conquest - is stronger than we are , or thinks they are , then peace is no longer safe .

Their aim has been : ( 1 ) To block the minimum wage bill ( which in its first year of operation would have raised the wages of an estimated 1 million Negro workers ) , the aged health care , housing , and education bills ( which also would have meant major advances in the rights of our lower income and minority group members ) . A majority of Republicans voted against the minimum wage bill , all but one voted against social security health care for the aged and not one Republican on the House Rules Committee was ready to let adequate education and housing bills come up for final action .	He made this motion to table at a time when we had unlimited time to consider the measure . These bills - housing , education , medical help , and minimum wage - are vitally important to millions of American - Negroes and whites because they affect all those Americans who are on the lower level of our economic ladder . I strongly support civil rights and I am wholeheartedly committed to the implementation of the platform , but to use civil rights at this time as a method of defeating other bills whose passage are also essential would have meant that the session would have ended in complete failure .

Can there really be any doubt that systematic prepayment under the insurance system is to be preferred to the increased drain on general revenues ? Can there be anything but doubt about the ability of the States to raise money - especially when about half of the States now fail to match all the Federal funds at their disposal ? Can we really , in this day and age , say in all honesty that 50 different States with 50 different abilities to finance medical care are to be preferred to an orderly , nationwide system ? Can we really say that we favor social insurance for retirement , survivors and disability benefits , so as to avoid putting the relief tag on our citizens , and then make an exception when they become ill ? Mr. President , the answers are clear . I urge the adoption of the Anderson amendment .	They are : ( 1 ) Hospitalization up to 120 days ; ( 2 ) Nursing home care up to 240 days ; ( 3 ) Nursing and other health services at home up to 360 days ; ( 4 ) Outpatient diagnostic services . Such a program will be soundly financed ; it will provide a balanced program of basic health services ; it will relieve the burden upon our hospitals by providing incentives for nonhospital care ; it emphasizes preventive medical care ; and it tends to reduce the overall cost of the program by using less expensive yet more effective medical techniques . Enactment of this legislation during the present session will be a fitting climax to this 25th anniversary of the Social Security Act and mark a historic step forward in sustaining the dignity and self-reliance of our Nation 's senior citizens .

I take my case to you because I am confident that the American people are not going to tolerate pockets of poverty and chronic unemployment in this land , the waste of idle men and women who are ready , willing , and able to work , or the decline of our farms .

Until a Democrat is in the White house , the Republicans can block action on an adequate minimum wage , they can water down medical care for the aged , they can play politics with civil rights , they can block action on a decent housing bill and a good school bill . But they can not block the American people on November 8. The theme of this campaign is going to be action - action at home to keep pace with our growing needs , to help the unfortunate , to build a still greater nation - and action abroad , to match the rise in Communist power , to meet the turbulent revolutions reshaping our globe .	 I am sure that the threat of a White House veto mentioned by every speaker opposing the amendment contributed to this defeat . In addition , it should be noted that only one Republican voted for this sound approach to the medical care for the aged program .  This vote demonstrates that if we 're going to have effective legislation in this and other fields , we 're going to have to have an administration that will provide leadership and a Congress that will act .

Other Republicans attacked minimum wage as  communism  and the  road to economic hell  - 93 percent of the Republicans in Congress voted to kill the bill calling for a 25-cent minimum wage and the Republicans have opposed every increase in the minimum wage ever since . Today the Social Security Act is regarded as the most important and beneficial single piece of social legislation in American history .	This administration has stood still and so has Richard Nixon for 14 years that I have been in the Congress with him . On all the great issues which disturb our country , minimum wage , social security , unemployment compensation , houses , roads , schools , hospitals , our parties have divided and we have divided , and the great questions for the 1960 's are how is it going to be possible to move this country forward , build its economy , provide employment for its people .

But in the past 8 years we have not demonstrated such concern . We have reacted to a crisis in Guatemala or a crisis in Panama or a crisis in Cuba , and then , when the crisis was over , we continued to ignore the long-range problems and needs which were at the root of all the trouble .

For Mr. Nixon to say $ 1.25 an hour is  extreme ,  as he did , is underrating the great potential strength of the American economy .	This is something we have been saying all along . The Nation should take this confession at its face value or it is Mr. Nixon and his party who have steadfastly opposed measures needed by the people of this country - who have fought raising the minimum wage to $ 1.25 , who have vetoed adequate measures for housing and education , who have opposed the raising of teachers ' salaries , who have fought the setting up of an adequate medical care plan under social security , who have twice vetoed bills destined to give America 's depressed areas a chance .

He promises to impose a mandatory medical care plan for the aged on every one of the millions of citizens covered by social security , no matter what their personal desires , and leave 3 million Americans with no medical care program at all .

These are my goals .	 But Mr. Nixon and the party he leads say they are content , just as they have always been content , in the face of poverty and unemployment and an America with its most urgent needs unmet . The Republican Party which Mr. Nixon leads today is the same Republican Party which for half a century has opposed every single progressive measure which the Democrats have designed to improve human welfare and reduce human misery - the party which fought against the New Deal and tried to block the Fair Deal - the party which , in the past 8 years , has vetoed aid to areas of unemployment , blocked efforts to improve unemployment compensation , opposed raising the minimum wage , refused to expand the distribution of surplus food to the hungry , and failed to offer one single program to increase the welfare of the American people .

Here at home we are only beginning to sense the impact of automation , machines replacing men , we are only beginning to feel the pressures on our schools and colleges - on the cost of medical care for the aged - on farms caught in a cost-price squeeze - in cities caught in a downward spiral of slums , high taxes , and the flight to outlying areas .

It seems to me it would have been far more valuable for us to be striking a blow for freedom , to stand for freedom , to use our great influence , which we had in Cuba at that time to persuade Batista to hold free elections , so that the people of Cuba could have a free choice . The fact of the matter is that when I was in Cuba 4 years ago , the American Ambassador said to me he was the second most powerful man in Cuba .	We occupy a position of leadership in the world , but I think we can do far better , than our record of the past 2 or 3 or 4 years . Can you tell me anywhere in a crisis , from Cuba to the Congo to Laos , where the United States has been ahead of events ? We have held out our hands of friendship to the people of Latin America before we had to , where we did it at our own free will rather than at the point of Castro 's pistol ? We go now and offer a program of Africa to the United Nations . We offer a program of aid ; We offer scholarships to the Congo .	Kennedy_October_1_1960	Kennedy_September_22_1960

For example , the very quick way that he went to work on asking the legislature to provide for West Virginia 's participation in the new program for medical care for the aged . This is typical of a man of action , a young , vigorous leader of West Virginia .	Governor Rockefeller 's position on the medical care , as we both indicated prior to the convention , has differed from the position that I have taken . He favors financing the medical care out of Social Security and I favor the Federal - State program , which was contained in the Javits bill which , as you recall , was defeated in the Senate .

Take a specific field : Senator Kennedy 's campaign to talk us into a recession has now reached phase 2. If elected , he says , he will counsel with President Eisenhower about how to deal with it .	He was only talking about theory . And as far as Cuba was concerned , he really meant to say the same thing we 've been doing all the time , to give moral support to freedom throughout the world .

0829	medical care,health care	support	I believe the issue is very clear , and the people of this State should understand them . They are between a party which regards $ 1.25 minimum wage as too extreme , a party and a candidate which regards medical care for the aged tied to social security as too extreme , between a party which vetoes an area redevelopment bill as too extreme , between a party which regards a progressive farm policy which will bring supply and demand into balance as too extreme . Now , if you regard those programs as extreme , I believe you should support Mr. Nixon and the Republican Party .	His figures are wholly fictitious . But how can anyone figure the cost of the Republican platform ? How much have they cost the taxpayer for the dams and highways that cost more now than they did when they should have been built ? How can you measure the cost of increased juvenile delinquency bred in the slums they refuse to clean up ? How can you measure the cost to their families of the medical care aged persons are denied ? How can you measure the cost every consumer bears in high interest rates - or the cost of an abandoned farms - or the cost of illness caused by polluted water ? How much more are emergency programs in foreign aid costing us because we did not long ago take the steps we should have taken before a crisis was reached in the Middle East , in Latin America or in Africa ? And how do you measure the cost to a country whose security is in danger of being nibbled away by brush-fire wars too limited to justify the use of the massive retaliation our defense budgets have forced us to rely upon ? I do not call that economy . The Republican Party is one of waste - the waste of our human resources and the waste of our natural resources .	Kennedy_October_5_1960	Kennedy_October_4_1960

But it is freedom that is new , and despotism and tyranny that is as old as civilization is - and it is freedom that will win - not because of any law of history - but because we will have the strength and the determination that will bring the victory .	Everywhere I go in this campaign , I find people asking : What 's the matter with America ? Why are we slipping , why are we losing friends around the world ? Why are we losing the lead to Russia ? Why are n't we meeting the Communist challenge - from Cuba to the Congo , from India to Indonesia ? Four years ago the cold war was being carried on thousands of miles away . This year it spread to within 90 miles of Florida to Cuba . And next week when Mr. Khrushchev and Mr. Castro arrive in New York they will bring the cold war to within 12 miles of the Bergen Mall .

In fact , our prestige in Latin America has fallen so low that - at the recent Inter - American Foreign Ministers Conference - we were unable to persuade our former good neighbors to pass a resolution even criticizing Cuba by name . Now , 2 years later , following blunder after blunder , defeat after defeat , the Republicans decide to combat communism by cutting off exports long after the time has passed when such a move might have had a really significant impact - long after our Cuban exports have declined drastically - and long after , as Mr. Nixon must privately recognize , Mr. Castro himself had already embarked on a deliberate program to cut down American exports .	It is a program like this which is the ultimate answer to Castro and the Communists . For if Latin America is moving forward , if it is progressing under democratic government , then eventually the people of Cuba too will demand freedom for themselves , and Communist rule in Latin America will perish where it began - in the streets of Havana . I believe in a Western Hemisphere where we in the United States do not speak atronizingly of  our backyard  or our  little brothers ,  and where the people of South America do not speak with hostility of the  colossus of the north  or shout  Yankee go home .

Mr. Nixon 's contention that the hard-hit unemployment areas of the country would have received more help under the administration area redevelopment bill than under the Douglas - Flood bill , which I supported and which President Eisenhower vetoed , is patently absurd . The Vice President is reported to have said in Scranton , Pa .	 But Mr. Nixon and the party he leads say they are content , just as they have always been content , in the face of poverty and unemployment and an America with its most urgent needs unmet . The Republican Party which Mr. Nixon leads today is the same Republican Party which for half a century has opposed every single progressive measure which the Democrats have designed to improve human welfare and reduce human misery - the party which fought against the New Deal and tried to block the Fair Deal - the party which , in the past 8 years has voted aid to areas of unemployment , blocked efforts to improve unemployment compensation , opposed raising the minimum wage , refused to expand the distribution of surplus food to the hungry , and failed to offer one single program to increase the welfare of the American people .

When he was there in 1955 , he said , and you can judge his experience ,  I am convinced that communism has passed its highwater mark in Latin America ,  at a time when the Communists were about to communize Cuba .

They voted against the 25 cents in 1935 , and they voted against the $ 1.25 in 1960 . They voted against the social security in 1935 , and they voted against the medical care for the aged in 1960 .	The Republican leadership of the Senate knows full well that under the parliamentary situation of these final crowded weeks - and in the political atmosphere of rancor that developed - no significant civil rights measure could have passed . This same political atmosphere has also prevented action on a farm bill and on adequate minimum wage , housing , health care for the aged , and education bills .

0867	unemployment	no_relation	Throughout the entire Nation men and women - almost 4 million of them - are looking for jobs . Economists tell us that an unemployment rate of 6 percent is the danger signal . When a community passes that point it is officially regarded as an area of  substantial labor surplus .	There are only two reasons , in my opinion , for an unbalanced budget . One , if there is a great national emergency requiring an expenditure by the Federal Government to protect the security of the United States , or , two , if there is serious unemployment which requires action by the Federal Government . The most serious , potent peacetime deficit in the history of the United States was in 1958 , when we ran a $ 12 billion deficit .	Kennedy_September_19_1960	Kennedy_September_6_1960
0868	minimum wage	no_relation	But progressive legislation has not been the aim of the Republican leadership . Their aim has been : ( 1 ) To block the minimum wage bill ( which in its first year of operation would have raised the wages of an estimated 1 million Negro workers ) , the aged health care , housing , and education bills ( which also would have meant major advances in the rights of our lower income and minority group members ) . A majority of Republicans voted against the minimum wage bill , all but one voted against social security health care for the aged and not one Republican on the House Rules Committee was ready to let adequate education and housing bills come up for final action .	They are equally entitled to share in economic progress . The fiscal burden of an inadequate minimum wage law lies upon the community , and thus upon every taxpayer . In New York City , 44 percent of the families to whom relief is extended include those who are wage earners but whose incomes are inadequate .	Kennedy_September_1_1960	Kennedy_August_10_1960
0870	medical care,health care	support	This last session of the Congress for the last 4 weeks is a vivid example of what can happen when the country is divided in its leadership ; because the Republican Party opposed the $ 1.25 minimum wage , we did n't get it . Because the Republican Party - and only one Senator voted against them - opposed medical care for the aged tied to social security , which had the endorsement of Governor Rockefeller , as well as the Democratic Party , and it was beaten by five votes . And Time magazine this week said that the leader of the Republican Party smiled when he heard the results - this is the kind of thing which has happened in the month of August .	It does not depend upon the uncertainties of financing from general revenues . I feel strongly that there must be no means test in providing medical care insurance .

Franklin Roosevelt proposed a 25-cent minimum wage , back in the middle thirties ; 90 percent of the Republicans voted against it . We proposed this summer a minimum wage of $ 1.25 and 90 percent of the Members of the House of Representatives voted against it .	When a political party votes , in 1935 , 98 percent against the 25-cent minimum wage , I know what the party stands for ; and when that same political party in 1960 votes in the House of Representatives 85 percent against $ 1.25 minimum wage in 1960 , I know the Republican Party stands where it has always stood-against ; not for , but against . Mr. Nixon leads a party which regards $ 1.25 minimum wage as extreme , which regards medical care for the aged tied to social security as extreme .

I stand here where Harry Truman stood and Franklin Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson in this century .	No. I think we had to come back . I think it would have been a much bigger mistake for us to say that we were not going to do anything about these matters , and that we were going to adjourn and not do anything about some of the appropriation bills , the Antarctic Treaty , education , housing , minimum wage , and care of the aged , that we were not going to try .

0876	unemployment	support	 Is it true ? And the answer is , Of course it is n't true . The answer is - and now I 'm going to give you my version - the answer is that America , is moving forward , that unemployment went down more than usual last month and employment went up to record heights . The answer is that America will continue to move forward , continue to move forward , that is , unless we have some of our politicians talk us into a recession - and we are n't going to allow that to happen .	He knows it , the economy is moving up . He knows that unemployment went down more than seasonally last month and employment went up more than seasonally , and you know a funny thing ?

0877	unemployment	support	First , we must spur the rate of national economic growth so as to take up the slack now existing in heavy industry - such as steel , chemicals , and autos - and in service industries - such as building and construction . Secondly , we must administer existing defense and other Federal procurement programs in a manner that , consistent with the national interest , areas with idle facilities and idle skills are given priority before those skills are disgraced and chronic unemployment takes over . Third , to that end , we will repass , and I would sign , the depressed-areas bill twice vetoed by the Republicans .	Today the country has 126 areas of substantial labor surplus , areas of declining industry , where there is poverty and hunger , where men have been searching for work , but can not find that work . Unemployment in any of these areas harms the entire Nation , depriving all our industry of markets , decreasing total purchasing power , and depriving us of needed production . The distress may be regional , but the problem is a national problem .	Kennedy_September_28_1960	Kennedy_September_27_1960
0878	cuba	no_relation	It is rather interesting that Mr. Nixon in Havana , Cuba , in 1955 , gave an interview in which he spoke rather glowingly of the stability of the Batista regime . It seems to me it would have been far more valuable for us to be striking a blow for freedom , to stand for freedom , to use our great influence , which we had in Cuba at that time to persuade Batista to hold free elections , so that the people of Cuba could have a free choice . The fact of the matter is that when I was in Cuba 4 years ago , the American Ambassador said to me he was the second most powerful man in Cuba .	And , finally , instead of the hoped-for general relaxation of world tension , the Soviets have stepped up their efforts to create disorder , danger and division . They have established an Iron Curtain outpost only 90 miles from our shores in the once friendly nation of Cuba . They have , for the first time , extended their sphere of influence into Africa .

0879	disarmament	no_relation	Why , then , Mr. Khrushchev , have you decided to come ? It has been suggested that you may have four possible objectives in mind . First , it has been suggested that your objective is to pose as a champion of peace and disarmament . You are said to be bringing new disarmament proposals with you .	Secondly , peace requires an America that is planning , preparing , and striving for disarmament and other steps toward peace . Disarmament today is just as complicated as armaments - involving complex problems of surveillance , reconnaissance , seismography , atmospheric sampling and testing stations . A successful blueprint for a safe disarmament is as difficult to devise as a successful blueprint for modern war .	Kennedy_September_16_1960	Kennedy_September_9_1960
0880	disarmament	support	I know that you must never make a concession to him without getting one in return . I know that you must never agree to disarmament , for example , unless you have an ironclad agreement from him that he 's going to do likewise . I know that that kind of firmness is what leads to peace .	I see him , ruthless , tough , completely a man dedicated to one purpose only - the evil purpose of conquering the world , and this is what I know . If America ever makes the mistake of entering into a disarmament agreement , which he does not also keep with inspection , it will increase the danger of war rather than reduce it , and I 'll tell you why : We can not leave to a man who is the enemy of peace power to start a war and destroy the world . We have to have the power because we are friends of peace .	Nixon_October_25_1960	Nixon_October_22_1960
0883	unemployment	support	By pursuing this goal we keep faith with those who save ; we protect those who live on a fixed income ; and we build world confidence in the soundness and integrity of the dollar . It is equally urgent that we do not achieve this kind of stability at the expense of any one group in the economy , such as farmers - or at the price of recessions , unemployment , and stagnation . I believe we can keep our prices stable while maintaining higher and more stable levels of production and employment .	The figure prior to this was 8 percent , which had 8 percent over a period of a year or 18 months . I believe that that program could be useful in using defense contracts most of which are not by bid but which are negotiated , to put those in areas where it is possible , where there is chronic unemployment and little hope for new industry . I would feel both of those , plus the coal research bill , plus the national fuels policy , I believe all of those would be of assistance in eastern Kentucky and these other hard-hit areas .

These are the times that you can read and have the time to read that you will never have later , and you can get the opportunity to specialize much later . You can learn about political science by participating in political organizations , and I would say certainly a political science course under the very able people who instruct you in our colleges and universities is worth while , but particularly to those who want to enter public service , if I could leave just one note - Remember , that while the broad background in the humanities and history and literature would seem to be very remote from the problems of Ghana and Cuba , from the problems of what we do about health care and what we do about the filibuster , remember those are the courses that will give you the judgment and the depth that is needed to react properly and intelligently to these great issues when they come before you years later , if you happen to enter public life . The last point that I would make is this : I want everybody here to certainly feel the necessity for , as I put it , going into politics ; I do n't mean all of you should run for office .

0886	unemployment	no_relation	For in 1960 , as in 1932 , people are in trouble . There may not be mass unemployment , but there is creeping unemployment - in steel , in textiles , in coal , in housing . There may not be soup kitchens , but there are depressed areas in Buffalo and Pittsburgh and West Virginia and Kentucky .	Now , if you regard those programs as extreme , I believe you should support Mr. Nixon and the Republican Party . But if you believe that you can not have a prosperous town in this State if your agricultural income continues to drop , if you recognize that under the program which Mr. Nixon put forward , which is a continuation of the Benson program , and corn which sold 8 years ago for $ 1.50 sells in this State at 95 cents today , will sell next year at 80 cents , and down and down it will go , because this administration 's farm program provides for a free market price , and the free market price for corn in this country with unlimited production will take that down at least 20 percent below what it is selling at today , and if any merchant in this State feels he can prosper with corn on the downward trend , with unemployment in this State , at 6.8 percent to 7 percent , any merchant in this country who feels he can move forward when steel production is at 50 percent of capacity , which it is in the United States , when 7 out of 8 International Harvester plants in Illinois closed down in the last 2 weeks , and they may open some of them in October - if that is the kind of country you want and that is the kind of economy you believe in , if those are the programs you want , I believe you should vote for Mr. Nixon . But if you believe it is time this country moved forward , if you believe we have stood on dead center long enough , if you believe that the balance of power in the world should shift in our direction instead of against us , if you believe that the United States should be first - not first but , if , sometimes or perhaps , but first , period .

0888	cuba	support	And the slight impact which Mr. Nixon 's latest policy will have - is even more diluted by our complete failure to seek the cooperation of our allies - thus making it simple for Mr. Castro to turn to other South American and European nations for those few goods which he ca n't get from Russia or Red China . For 6 years before Castro came to power the Republicans did absolutely nothing to stop the rise of communism in Cuba . Our Ambassadors repeatedly warned the Republicans of mounting danger .	But if that is what the American people want , if they want to close in and let the future pass them by , take Mr. Nixon . But if you want to move again , if you want this country to meet its responsibilities , if you have confidence that there is nothing we can not do , once given the opportunity to do so , if you believe that people want to be free as they do , that Khrushchev and Castro and the rest of them represent a system which is as old as time , domination of one man by another , which goes against the grain of every person whether they live in the Soviet Union or whether they live in Cuba - they want to be free . They may be misled , they may be dominated by a police state , they may be scared in other countries that the tide is moving in the direction of the Communists .

He says we ca n't afford to do what this great country should be doing in education , in programs for the aging , in medical care , in housing , in development of our natural resources . I say we can .	To meet this distress , the Democrats proposed that the medical expenses of retired Americans be financed through the social security system . But Mr. Nixon and the Republicans opposed medical care for the aged and they managed to defeat it in the Congress .

But we need not look only to the skies for new horizons .	We can not parley on the basis of equality with the Soviet unless we maintain a military position of equality with them , and that goes in the traditional weapons and in missiles and in outer space . One of the reasons why we have never been able to get an agreement on the disarmament of outer space is because we are second in outer space , and the Soviet Union will not give way their advantage . We arm to parley , and we must be strong if we are going to disarm and maintain our security .	Kennedy_October_29_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960

They will keep on driving and expanding and gaining without regard to all the kitchen debates and without regard to what goes on in the United Nations unless we have a President and a country in the 1960 's that acts first and acts fast .	Everywhere I go in this campaign , I find people asking : What 's the matter with America ? Why are we slipping , why are we losing friends around the world ? Why are we losing the lead to Russia ? Why are n't we meeting the Communist challenge - from Cuba to the Congo , from India to Indonesia ? Four years ago the cold war was being carried on thousands of miles away .

0893	minimum wage	support	[ Response from the audience . ] I want someone to tell me a single piece of domestic legislation that Mr. Nixon ever proposed that stood for progress for the people , from minimum wage , social security - this summer we tried to pass a bill for medical care for the older citizens . Under the bill , which the President signed , before you or your mother and father , who may be retired , who may have a heart attack or cancer or sick for several months - before they can get any assistance under that program , they first have to sign a petition that they are medically indigent .	One , I believe , is the responsibility of all of us , those of us who serve in the Congress , those of us who may serve in the Presidency or in the executive branch , to bring up to date , to make modern , those programs which have been part of our political life , part of our national life , for 20 or 25 or 30 years . In other words , to pass a minimum wage bill which brings wages up to date . The first minimum wage bill in 1935 was 25 cents an hour .	Kennedy_October_27_1960	Kennedy_October_15_1960

It would , as we have seen from the immediate response of shock and dismay in Latin America , alienate every one of our sister American Republics whose friendship you have acknowledged is of vital importance to our efforts against communism . 3. It would give Mr. Khrushchev a valid excuse to intervene in Cuba on the side of the Castro government , saying that the United States had intervened in violation of its treaty obligations in trying to overthrow the existing government . 4. If this happened , your policy could lead to World War III .	It worked with the Arbenz Communist government in Guatemala which we inherited from our predecessors . It will work , I believe , with Cuba . And on the other side there is the wrong and demagogic way - the right that I have pointed out , the wrong which Senator Kennedy has advocated - and I say this is a way of shooting from the hip on matters gravely affecting the security of the United States .

Do you feel that everything that has to be done to provide better working conditions for our people and better housing , and medical care for the aged , which affects us all , because we all have someone in our family that needs assistance - and under the bill which the Congress passed and which was signed by the administration , before anyone can get medical aid , they have to sign a petition that they are indigent , that they are broke , that they have expended their money , that they are paupers . I believe in medical care for the aged , nursing care , all tied to social security , which has served our people so well for 25 years .	And I come here tonight to ask the support of the people of New York in November . I could talk on many subjects tonight - the need for an effective minimum wage ; the medical care for the aged ; of Federal aid to education , and all the rest .

0897	unemployment	no_relation	They would have thought of the people and we would have had a bill that would have done something about it . I say to you today , and I pledge to you , that America , first , can not afford to allow any pockets of unemployment to exist . We can not afford not to use the tremendous human resources that are here in this area that are not being used .	 This letter from this 12-year-old boy sums up the concern that I found all over the United States as we have traveled this country north , east , west , and south . This concern and the idea that this is the major of this campaign is held not only by Republicans but by Democrats and independents , and I find that as far as this particular issue is concerned , it transcends all the rest , because while people , of course , are interested in how government can provide the climate in which we can continue to have good jobs and high wages and how government can provide the necessary procedures through which we can have social security in times of unemployment and better schools and hospitals - while they are interested in these things , they know it does n't make any difference if we had all those things if we are not around to enjoy them . I say to you the biggest , major issue which we should talk about today above all others is this : Which of the two candidates for the Vice Presidency and the Presidency can best provide the leadership for America and the free world in these next 4 years which will keep the peace without surrender and which will extend the freedom throughout the world .	Nixon_September_19_1960	Nixon_September_15_1960
0899	medical care,health care	no_relation	Now , people disagree with that . Senator Kennedy and Senator Johnson believe that the social security route , which would compel all people - whether they wanted health insurance or not - to , in effect , have it through subscribing to social security , is the best one to provide medical care or people over 65 . I believe that the most effective method is through a program which will provide a choice whereby people who want to have the protection for catastrophic illnesses or , for that matter , for noncatastrophic illnesses , if they so desire , can have it , but where they are not forced to have it if they do not desire , and where they can choose getting that protection through government or through private plans , which they might choose , with some government assistance .	Let me speak now of a more important issue . I am sure when you heard the words  more important  some of you thought :  What could be more important than education for our children , a better job , adequate hospitals and health care , all these things that I have mentioned ?  The answer is :  We can have the best social security system , the best education , the best jobs that we can imagine , and it is not going to do any good unless we are around to enjoy them .  So I urge all of you , without regard to your partisan affiliations , to have this major issue in mind as you go to the polls on election day :  Which of the two candidates , which of the two tickets , do you believe best provides the kind of leadership that will keep the peace for America and keep it without a surrender of principle ?  Here we think we have a good record .	Nixon_August_24_1960	Nixon_August_17_1960
0900	medical care,health care	support	That is the same party that voted 90 percent against 25 cents minimum wage . I do n't lead a party which voted 90 percent against social security , which ran a presidential candidate , Alf Landon , in 1936 , calling for the repeal of social security , and yet that is the same party in 1960 that voted against medical care for the aged . I think the record tells us something .	What have they done since President Taft ? What have they done on social secunty and minimum wages and housing and resource development , on which they run and issue papers today ? Where do they stand when those measures were proposed ? Where do they stand in 1960 when we tried to move the minimum wage from $ 1 an hour to $ 1.25 ? Mr. Nixon says it is too extreme . When we try to provide medical care for the aged on social security , instead they pass a bill by which you have to take a pauper 's oath before you are entitled to medical care . What do they do on resource development ? Their policy was officially called  No new starts .	Kennedy_October_12_1960	Kennedy_October_10_1960

0902	unemployment	no_relation	And unemployment is not insignificant to the Democratic Party - which has always pursued a policy of full employment - which has never said that there  must be some unemployment  and which is going to see that there are jobs for all Americans in the sixties . In fact , unemployment is only insignificant to Mr. Nixon and a Republican Party which has opposed every Democratic effort to put men back to work in the past 8 years - which has complacently stood by while unemployment rose from less than 2 million in 1952 to 4 million today and while Michigan lost more than 100,000 jobs despite an expanding population . For I believe that the American people are going to reject a party which - again in Mr. Nixon 's words - believes that  unemployment is inevitable ,  a party which lacks faith in the capacity of a strong and growing America to provide jobs for all its people , a party which , in the most fundamental sense , is letting America run down because it is failing to build America up , a party whose candidate is all too ready to threaten war but is unwilling to build up the strength which is the only guarantee of peace , who is always willing to speak loudly , but is unwilling to be sure that America carries a big stick .	This revolution in nationhood has been but one of several other revolutions , all of which have been going on at the same time - and all of tremendous importance to history . There is the revolution in transportation and communication which is shrinking our world with every passing day ; there is the revolution in medicine which is enabling human beings to become healthier and live longer ; the revolution in automation , which increases our abundance , but also our unemployment ; the revolution of farm production , which could bring the eventual elimination of hunger in the world , but which so far has only brought disaster to the farm family ; the revolution of our exploding urban population which brings with it the problems of overerowded schools , urban blight , and crowded slums . There is the revolution in education , which sees more and more of our young people going to college , while two-thirds of the world 's population still remains illiterate ; the tremendously exciting revolution in space , which will soon carry man to other worlds undreamed of ; and the equally exciting and morally refreshing revolution for human rights for all citizens here at home .

In pledging assistance to American Indians we are offering them new opportunities not only as Americans of Indian descent , but as American citizens who , through no fault of their own , have not had these opportunities until now . Our Indian platform pledge , you will note , harmonizes fully with other , more general , platform pledges , such as that to assist depressed areas of chronic unemployment , to provide decent housing , and to inaugurate a Youth Conservation Corps .

Fourth , we will strengthen our planning the preparation for disarmament . One of the most glaring failures of the past 8 years has been our failure to prepare properly for any arms control conference since the end of the Korean war .

The intentions of the Republicans today was to use civil rights legislation to block the enactment of bills for Federal-aid to education , housing , medical assistance to the aged and the lifting of the minimum wage .

Concern was expressed at that time about changing our immigration laws to allow more refugees to come in , concern with regard to the effect on employment and unemployment in this country , concern as to how these people could be assimilated . His answer was that every wave of refugees that has come to the United States has strengthened America rather than weakened it .	I know what it is in the little store in which I worked to see a child of an unemployed man come in and have to ask to put things on the bill , knowing that his dad or hers probably was n't going to get a job for a while .

We want to go the extra mile to strengthen the United Nations and the instruments of peace , but under no circumstances do we want the next President to be a man who will be fooled , who will make concessions to them without getting concessions in return , and , above all , we do not want the next President to be one who will reduce the strength of America unless we 're absolutely sure that the enemies of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time .

For this policy has not worked .	Senator John F. Kennedy today declared that-- the midyear budget report shows our fiscal stake in full employment . Rising unemployment and slack business conditions will cause a loss of at least $ 2 billion in anticipated revenue-- Kennedy said .

What have not been solved are those problems which lie largely in the realm of public action - bad housing , poverty , recessions , unemployment , discrimination , crowded and obsolete schools and hospitals and libraries , inadequate recreation , the breakdown of mass transportation , polluted air and water , juvenile delinquency . These problems are compounded as we become more and more an urban nation .	Well , in eastern Kentucky the problem is comparable to the problem in West Virginia and the other States , where coal has brought in new machinery and automation has taken the jobs of men . I believe that the best program that we can put forward , as I suggested in my speech , was the so-called area redevelopment bill , which provides loans to small business , which provides loans and grants to communities to provide fresh water , which provides assistance for vocational retraining to train men for new jobs , loans for small businessmen at low rates of interest , supplemental unemployment compensation . The second program that I think would be useful is to restore defense manpower policy No.4, which provides that defense contracts shall be steered into those areas which have chronic amounts of surplus labor .

In other words , I do not like to see the United States offer assistance to Latin America as a result of difficulties in Cuba . I would like to see us offer the hand of friendship to Latin America because of a traditional conviction that the United States can not maintain its freedom unless Latin America is a strong and viable and growing hemisphere .	We talked tough when the people of Hungary revolted - but he crushed the revolt . We talked tough when communism began to grow in Cuba - but Cuba is a Communist satellite today .

0947	cuba	no_relation	Mr. Nixon 's new Cuba policy is too little and too late . After doing nothing for 6 years while the conditions that give rise to communism grew - after ignoring the repeated warning of our Ambassadors that the Communists were about to take over Cuba - after standing helplessly by while the Russians established a new satellite only 90 miles from American shores - Mr. Nixon and the Republicans , after 2 years of inaction since Castro took power , now attempt to make up for this incredible history of blunder , inaction , retreat and failure , by cutting off several million dollars worth of exports in a move which will have virtually no effect by itself in removing Communist rule from Cuba . In cutting off a carefully limited number of the American goods which can be sent to Cuba Mr. Nixon has made a dramatic but almost empty gesture - a gesture which will have so little impact on Castro as to be almost meaningless .	It is a program like this which is the ultimate answer to Castro and the Communists . For if Latin America is moving forward , if it is progressing under democratic government , then eventually the people of Cuba too will demand freedom for themselves , and Communist rule in Latin America will perish where it began - in the streets of Havana . I believe in a Western Hemisphere where we in the United States do not speak atronizingly of  our backyard  or our  little brothers ,  and where the people of South America do not speak with hostility of the  colossus of the north  or shout  Yankee go home .

Mr. Khrushchev is in our country now , as he was a year ago , confident that all is going his way , smug in his recent successes , and piously talking about peace , colonialism , and disarmament . But how can you talk of peace , Mr. Khrushchev , when you and your Chinese Communist friends are undermining the peace every day , creating disorder and danger wherever you move ? How can you talk of colonialism when you are surrounded by your puppet dictators and when you hold in an iron grip a great empire stretching from East Berlin to Vietnam ? How can you talk of the achievements of your system , even if you beat us again by putting a man into outer space ? For we know that while you may bring a man back from outer space , you rarely bring one back alive from Siberia .	We want a peace in which the world is not teetering constantly on the brink of war . We want a peace in which the funds now poured into the destructive forces of armaments may be channeled into the constructive results of disarmament - into great multi-Nation efforts to eradicate disease , harness rivers , eliminate illiteracy , and exploit the frontiers of space .

When all the vague generalities are stripped away , nothing more is being offered by opponents of the Anderson amendment than an increase in the public assistance program to provide some increased medical care for the indigent . The committee bill does improve our public assistance to the most needy .	They are : ( 1 ) Hospitalization up to 120 days ; ( 2 ) Nursing home care up to 240 days ; ( 3 ) Nursing and other health services at home up to 360 days ; ( 4 ) Outpatient diagnostic services . Such a program will be soundly financed ; it will provide a balanced program of basic health services ; it will relieve the burden upon our hospitals by providing incentives for nonhospital care ; it emphasizes preventive medical care ; and it tends to reduce the overall cost of the program by using less expensive yet more effective medical techniques .

0953	unemployment	no_relation	Senator John F. Kennedy today declared that-- the midyear budget report shows our fiscal stake in full employment . Rising unemployment and slack business conditions will cause a loss of at least $ 2 billion in anticipated revenue-- Kennedy said . The failure of corporate profits to rise and the consequent loss of expected corporate tax collections has caused a substantial change in the budget picture .	Today almost 4 million Americans are out of work and another 3 million must struggle to maintain a decent standard of living on part-time work and half-full pay envelopes . And nowhere has the impact of Republican unemployment been greater than in the 126 sections of this country which are classified as areas of chronic labor surplus , areas where large numbers of men , long out of work , can not find new jobs , areas where unemployment compensation checks are runnning out , where industry has declined or collapsed , where families struggle for the bare essentials of a decent life , where thousands are forced to depend on meager and inadequate Government surplus food packages for existence . These are the rapidly growing islands of poverty in the midst of a rich and abundant America - islands which have been growing in number and expanding in size under the leadership of a Republican Party which is indifferent to the urgent human needs of our own people and which has fought against every effort of the Democratic Party to eliminate poverty and distress in America .

Certainly in this period we realize that the problems are difficult only because there is on the loose in the world a great aggressive force , a force which is fanatical which is ruthless , whose leaders do not follow the rules of international diplomacy , as we would like them to be followed , whose leaders - and I know them , and I speak from knowledge - are men who have one objective , and one only , and that is to conquer the world , conquer it without war , if they can , but willing to use any means , if that becomes necessary , and because when we have this kind of leadership , aggressive , always probing , always attempting to embarrass , always moving against us around the world , the period ahead is going to be a difficult one .

Lose us all our friends in Latin America , lose us our influence in the United Nations , because we would have broken every treaty if we had done what he wanted us to do .

I say that it 's time , with all this criticism of the President and his policies , that , in pointing out , as we should , the things that are wrong , that we recognize the things that are right about America as well .

It is our responsibility to bring those programs , extension of the right to vote , civil rights , minimum wage , housing , education , to increase the opportunity for all Americans to share in the abundance . And I do not share the view of the Vice President that these programs are extreme ; $ 1.25 minimum wage , not this year , not until 1962 , for those people already covered , not until 1964 for the newly covered , and still that bill was voted against by 75 to 80 percent of the Members of the House of Representatives who are Republicans .

Economists tell us that an unemployment rate of 6 percent is the danger signal . When a community passes that point it is officially regarded as an area of  substantial labor surplus .	To us the major issue is the fight against communism . But to most of the peoples of the world , that is a far-off battle - compared to their battles against poverty and disease and unemployment and illiteracy .

I do n't come to you saying ,  Forget what party I belong to .	In the midthirties , 90 percent of the Republican Party voted against a 25-cent minimum wage . This summer , as your Congressman can tell you , in the House of Representatives , 90 percent of the Republicans voted against a minimum wage of $ 1.25 an hour , $ 50 a week for a 40-hour week , for a business that makes more than a million dollars a year , and Mr. Nixon called it extreme .

The Republican Party which Mr. Nixon leads today is the same Republican Party which for half a century has opposed every single progressive measure which the Democrats have designed to improve human welfare and reduce human misery - the party which fought against the New Deal and tried to block the Fair Deal - the party which , in the past 8 years has voted aid to areas of unemployment , blocked efforts to improve unemployment compensation , opposed raising the minimum wage , refused to expand the distribution of surplus food to the hungry , and failed to offer one single program to increase the welfare of the American people . But Americans will not forget Mr. Nixon 's party this November - and they will return the Democrats to leadership so that all Americans can share in American abundance .

We are going to have to provide medical care for the aged tied to social security , because all the people are entitled to live out their lives in some kind of dignity , and we are going to have to provide equality of opportunity for all Americans . Now , you have to decide which party and which candidate based on their history , based on their statements in this campaign , based on their look into the future , can lead this country into the dangerous years of the 1960 's , which party and which candidate and which viewpoint can build in this country a strong society which will serve as an inspiration to the people around the world .

I have confidence in an America able to afford the best schools and the best teachers in the world - an America where no one is denied his full constitutional rights by reason of his race or religion - an America where every family lives in a decent home in a decent neighborhood - an America where the cost of living is not completely beyond those who work for a living - particularly those receiving an inadequate minimum wage of $ 1 an hour . I have confidence that America is capable of operating at full capacity - that we could consume in new schools and hospitals and dams and highways the full output of our steel mills now operating at only half their capacity .	By demonstrating that you are able and willing to assume your responsibilities on the local level , that you can be alert to the future needs of our citizens , that you can emphasize cooperation , instead of duplication , with other local governments , you have demonstrated your readiness to join with leaders at every level of government , and in both political parties , to make this a better , wiser , stronger America . Senator John F. Kennedy , Democrat of Massachusetts , tonight expressed strong satisfaction with the minimum wage bill , voted by the Senate 62 to 34 . The minimum wage bill , as passed by the Senate today , will extend protection of the minimum wage and the overtime requirements to approximately 4 million additional employees and will also provide for an increase to $ 1.25 in the existing minimum wage .

Unemployment is not insignificant to the families of the unemployed - families who are forced to live in substandard homes and are unable to maintain even a subsistence of living in the richest country on earth . Unemployment is not insignificant to the children of the unemployed who are deprived of decent clothing and a decent diet .

We can not do that by arguing with him - and we ca n't do that by smiling at him .

How do you meet the weekly budget ? What do you do , go down and get surplus food , which amounts to 5 cents a day per person ? What do you do about your children ? What do you do about the mortgage on your house ? After unemployment compensation runs out , then what do you do ? You move away or you work in another State or your wife goes to work . These are the things which divide our two parties .	Our efforts were equally successful in resisting attempts to remove the Railroad Retirement Board from civil service protection .

Rising unemployment and slack business conditions will cause a loss of at least $ 2 billion in anticipated revenue-- Kennedy said .

For the Mr. Nixon who can look upon your distress - and say all is well - is the same Mr. Nixon who , in the past 8 years , has led the fight against every Democratic measure designed to increase the welfare of the American people - to put men back to work - and to help rebuild the economically distressed areas of America .	They voted against the social security in 1935 , and they voted against the medical care for the aged in 1960 .

We have a minimum wage , but to be of any help at today 's prices it must be raised to $ 1.25 an hour . We have social security , but to meet the most basic need of older people today , it must be amended to include medical care .	I want to ask them three questions . They talk about prosperity : No.1, Mr. Nixon says $ 1.25 a hour minimum wage is extreme . Ninety percent of the Republicans voted against it .	Kennedy_November_4_1960	Kennedy_October_31_1960
1031	cuba	support	But his only reaction was to praise  the competence and stability  of the Batista dictatorship which was , even then , threatened by Communist activities - and to say that  communism has reached its high-water mark in Latin America  at a time when Communist influence was beginning to rise , and only a few short years before the Communists took over all of Cuba . Mr. Nixon saw nothing wrong in Cuba - he made no recommendations for action - he did not warn America that danger was growing - and as a result the Communists took over Cuba with virtually no opposition from the United States . Now the Communists have been in power for 2 years .	I approved of his trip . But who does Mr. Nixon think he fools in the last 3 weeks of an election , who does he think he fools when he says we will have no more debates after this week , as he goes around the country casting his innuendoes , suggesting that we in the Democratic Party are not as devoted to the cause of freedom , implying that for some reason or other we were misled by Khrushchev and he understood him all the time ? I was not the Vice President of the United States who presided over the communization of Cuba . [ Applause .	Kennedy_October_20_1960	Kennedy_October_18_1960
1032	disarmament	support	I am not satisfied to have only 100 experts scattered through the U.S. Government working on the sensitive and complex issue of disarmament . I regret that our negotiators at previous disarmament conferences too often have been ill prepared , ill advised , and ill staffed . We sincerely desire to live at peace with our neighbors .	We want a peace in which the world is not teetering constantly on the brink of war . We want a peace in which the funds now poured into the destructive forces of armaments may be channeled into the constructive results of disarmament - into great multi-Nation efforts to eradicate disease , harness rivers , eliminate illiteracy , and exploit the frontiers of space . We want a peace in which we can truly beat our swords into plowshares , our bombs into reactors , and our rockets into vehicles for exploring outer space .

1034	medical care,health care	support	Although 15 million Americans are forced to live in substandard dwellings - the Republican Party has adopted policies which have slowed down private housing - and consistently blocked Democratic efforts to enact programs to clear our slums , renew our cities , and provide decent homes for Americans of low and moderate incomes . And finally , although 9 million Americans over the age of 65 receive incomes of less than $ 20 a week - and 3 million more receive incomes of less than $ 40 a week - amounts on which they can not afford their higher medical bills - the Republican Party , only 2 weeks ago , blocked our efforts to provide medical care for the aged under social security . Some people say that this last brief session of the Congress was a handicap to the Democratic Party - and it is true that the Republicans blocked our efforts on every major front .	It does not depend upon the uncertainties of financing from general revenues . I feel strongly that there must be no means test in providing medical care insurance . Already 2 1/4 million of our older citizens must rely on public assistance for their daily needs .	Kennedy_September_8_1960	Kennedy_August_23_1960
1035	unemployment	support	 This letter from this 12-year-old boy sums up the concern that I found all over the United States as we have traveled this country north , east , west , and south . This concern and the idea that this is the major of this campaign is held not only by Republicans but by Democrats and independents , and I find that as far as this particular issue is concerned , it transcends all the rest , because while people , of course , are interested in how government can provide the climate in which we can continue to have good jobs and high wages and how government can provide the necessary procedures through which we can have social security in times of unemployment and better schools and hospitals - while they are interested in these things , they know it does n't make any difference if we had all those things if we are not around to enjoy them . I say to you the biggest , major issue which we should talk about today above all others is this : Which of the two candidates for the Vice Presidency and the Presidency can best provide the leadership for America and the free world in these next 4 years which will keep the peace without surrender and which will extend the freedom throughout the world .	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .

1036	disarmament	support	It is n't as spectacular as President Eisenhower has done to go before the U.N. and to lay it on the line for controlled disarmament - not phony disarmament - not where you simply have empty pledges , but a case where both sides will disarm . Because remember this : If we ever have disarmament where we disarm and the other side does n't , that means that we increase the risk of war rather than reduce it , and we 're not going to do that and we can be sure of that . [ Applause .	We do n't want that . Mr. Khrushchev gets before the United Nations and he tries to gain the initiative by coming out for another phony disarmament plan . Do we want that from our President ? No. Our President goes before the United Nations .	Nixon_October_5_1960	Nixon_October_1_1960
1037	disarmament	support	Our aspiration is for peace , not merely a peace which lasts between wars , not merely a peace which hangs on the brink of war , not merely a peace of the death , but a peace enforced and controlled by the United Nations against the universal danger of common destruction . We want a peace in which the funds now poured into the destructive implements of war may be channeled into the constructive results of disarmament , in a great multinational effort to harness our rivers , eradicate disease , take care of our children , care for the aged . We want a peace in which we can truly beat our swords into plowshares , and our hydrogen bombs into atomic reactors .	 It is impossible for us to provide for the disarmament of outer space , the disarmament of nuclear weapons , unless we are in a position of parity with the Soviet Union . This administration has less than 100 people working in the entire Federal Government on the subject of disarmament . I think we can do a better job than that .

1038	cuba	no_relation	I do not believe that our prestige and strength is increasing . I am not satisfied to have Mr. Castro not only raise the banner of revolt in Cuba against us , but all over Latin America . I am not satisfied to have Ghana and Africa , an independent country - Mr. Nixon visited it in 1957 gaining experience .	I am talking about the one friendly island that our own shortsighted policies helped make communism 's first Caribbean base : the island of Cuba . Two years ago in September of 1958 - bands of bearded rebels descended from Cuba 's Sierra Maestra Mountains and began their long march on Havana - a march which ended in the overthrow of the brutal , bloody , and despotic dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista . The slogans , the manifestos , and the broadcasts of this revolution reflected the deepest aspirations of the Cuban people .	Kennedy_October_8_1960	Kennedy_October_6_1960
1040	unemployment	support	Put your thumb down regardless of what you do . We are fighting a candidate , the Republican Party , that for 20 years has opposed what the people need , minimum wage , housing , unemployment compensation . The real issue is which party and which candidate can best strengthen the United States , can best serve the public interest .	If our economy is moving upward , then people are working , but if we stand still , if we have an administration frozen in the ice of its own indifference , if we have an administration which is interested - Mr. Nixon spoke at White Sulphur , W. Va . , to a group of businessmen in May. He said ,  As long as unemployment is under 4.5 million , it is not  - and I quote him -  a significant issue in the minds of the people .  I think it is .	Kennedy_October_20_1960	Kennedy_October_15_1960
1041	unemployment	no_relation	And in both 1958 and 1959 , an average of more than 1 million idle workers remained out of a job for more than 15 week - the highest number since before the war . These figures tell a human story - the story of unemployment benefits running out - of 3 million Americans force to live on an unhealthy , tasteless diet of surplus foods - a story of hardship and personal tragedy . What , then , does Mr. Nixon mean when he says we are enjoying the greatest prosperity that Americans have ever enjoyed ? Perhaps he believes that if only 1 out of every 10 Americans are unable to find full-time work , the other 9 out of every 10 must be doing all right .	I am proud of this support . I know that the American labor movement wants for America what I want for America : the elimination of poverty and unemployment , the reestablishment of America 's position of leadership in the world , the end of racial discrimination everywhere in our society . I know the American labor movement opposes what I oppose : complacency , unemployment , economic stagnation , and national insecurity .	Kennedy_September_19_1960	Kennedy_August_30_1960
1045	unemployment	support	I think that you know the issues of this campaign well . There is no community in the United States in the last 2 or 3 years that has learned a harder lesson of what it means to live under a Republican administration [ applause ] and an administration which has permitted unemployment in this community to double in the last 12 months . [ Response from the audience .	Mr. Nixon has fancy new labels for the old Benson product , and he talks of jail sentences and runaway inflation if my program is adopted - but the American farmer , who remembers that food prices were actually lower in 1952 when his income was much higher , agrees that it is time the laws of supply and demand were put to work for him instead of always operating against him . ( 4 ) Unemployment : Mr. Nixon , who thinks several million unemployed is inevitable and nothing to worry about , is satisfied today with what he calls our  unprecedented prosperity  - but I think we can do better in putting our unemployed back to work , using our idle capacity in steel , coal and other industries , and finding jobs for the thousands of young men and women who are pouring into our labor market every week of the year . ( 5 ) Trusting the voters : Mr. Nixon and the Republicans are unwilling to reveal to the American people reports containing the facts about our prestige , the truth about the Nixon - Khrushchev talks , the basis of the present missile gap as contained in the Gaither report , and the facts about whether we are heading for a third recession prepared by the Department of Commerce .

1046	cuba	no_relation	Do you know how many Voice of America programs in Spanish we have had to Latin America in the last 8 years ? None , except for the 3 months of the Hungarian crisis . Do we have a Voice of America program to Cuba today to tell them that Castro is lying , when he speaks about us ? To tell them that we want them to be free , that we believe in the democracy , that we are telling them our story ? Do you think we have a Government sponsored Voice of America program in Spanish to Cuba today ? No , let us come back from the mainland of China for a minute and worry about what is happening right off the mainland of the United States . [ Applause .	Only if we are strong as a nation - strong economically , strong militarily , strong educationally , strong in heart and purpose - can we assure our peace and security in an age where our enemies are overtaking us in missile power , are far surpassing us in broadcasts abroad , have penetrated for the first time into the Middle East and Africa , have outshone our efforts in science and space , and have rolled the Iron Curtain to 90 miles from our shores onto the once friendly island of Cuba . Mr. Nixon has n't mentioned Cuba very prominently in this campaign . He talks about standing firm in Berlin , standing firm in the Far East , standing up to Khrushchev , but he never mentions standing firm in Cuba - and if you ca n't stand up to Castro , how can you be expected to stand up to Khrushchev ? Earlier this month , I reviewed the sorry story of how under our very noses , and in part as the result of our own policies - Cuba had moved from a position of good neighbor to a position of bitter enemy .

1048	medical care,health care	support	[ Applause . ] During the last session of the Congress in August , we offered on the floor of the U.S. Senate a bill which would tie medical care for the aged to the social security system . We failed by five votes , and this was regarded as an ignominious defeat .	Although 15 million Americans are forced to live in substandard dwellings - the Republican Party has adopted policies which have slowed down private housing - and consistently blocked Democratic efforts to enact programs to clear our slums , renew our cities , and provide decent homes for Americans of low and moderate incomes . And finally , although 9 million Americans over the age of 65 receive incomes of less than $ 20 a week - and 3 million more receive incomes of less than $ 40 a week - amounts on which they can not afford their higher medical bills - the Republican Party , only 2 weeks ago , blocked our efforts to provide medical care for the aged under social security .

1049	minimum wage	support	[ Applause . ] The Republican Party , which in 1935 voted almost unanimously against the 25-cent minimum wage , voted almost unanimously against the $ 1.25 in 1960 . A Republican Party , which in 1935 voted 95 to 1 in the House of Representatives against the social security bill , voted 44 to 1 , with only one Republican , for medical care for the aged in the last session of the Congress .	I think the August session of the Congress offered in my opinion a very clear example of how unfortunate it would be to have 4 more years of a divided government with neither party bearing responsibility and both parties sharing power . After passing in the U.S. Senate a bill providing for $ l.25 minimum wage , we failed in the conference to secure the passage of that bill . After passing in the Senate of the United States a bill for aid for education , and a bill for aid for housing , we failed to get both of those bills to the floor of the House of Representatives for a vote , and every Republican member of the Rules Committee of the House voted against them going to the floor of the House of Representatives .

1050	cuba	support	It seems to me it would have been far more valuable for us to be striking a blow for freedom , to stand for freedom , to use our great influence , which we had in Cuba at that time to persuade Batista to hold free elections , so that the people of Cuba could have a free choice . The fact of the matter is that when I was in Cuba 4 years ago , the American Ambassador said to me he was the second most powerful man in Cuba . Today the Soviet Ambassador is , and the reason is because the United States did not use its influence .	Secondly , also before the threat reached that stage , each of these areas had been visited by Mr. Richard Nixon . Why was not our Latin American capital investment program strengthened in 1958 , after Mr. Nixon was there , instead of this summer at the point of Mr. Castro 's gun ? Why did we not encourage free elections in Cuba after Mr. Nixon was there in 1955 , in order to stave off a revolt against what he called in a Havana press conference in 1955  the competence and stability  of the Batista dictatorship ? Why are we suddenly embarking now on a crash program for African scholarships for students ? Last year we allocated no scholarships at all to the Congo , practically none to other French and Belgian colonies and , indeed , practically none to the continent of Africa itself . We have allocated more scholarships this summer to the Congo than we allocated to all of Africa a year ago .	Kennedy_October_1_1960	Kennedy_September_29_1960
1051	disarmament	no_relation	The catastrophic arms race , more costly than all of our budget put together , more costly than all the other things which we pay for , can not be eliminated merely by wishful thinking . But is n't it a somber fact that this administration has had less than 100 people working in the entire National Government on the subject of disarmament One-fifth as many as work for the U.S. Battle Monuments Commission are working on disarmament in this administration - 100 people scattered throughout the international government . And we can not avoid the menace of a Communist base on Cuba , only 90 miles from our shores , merely by wishing it had not happened , though I wish it had not .	But this administration has had fewer than 100 employees working full time in this field - less than one-fifth as many Government employees as are taking care of cemeteries and memorials for the U.S. Battle Monuments Commission . As a result , our disarmament proposals have lacked continuity and practicality - our delegates to arms-control conferences have been ill-prepared , ill-instructed , ill-staffed , and constantly changed . We have never adopted a comprehensive and meaningful position , and we have too often resorted instead to irresponsible grandstand plays .	Kennedy_November_4_1960	Kennedy_November_2_1960
1052	minimum wage	no_relation	We were not as successful as I hoped we would be . But I think the real difficulty is the fact that on the two bills which were most controversial , the $ 1.25 minimum wage , and the aid to the aged and social security , we were informed in both cases that if those bills passed , the President would veto them . All the President has to do to stop action is to veto any bill and he needs , according to the Constitution , only one-third plus one of either body to sustain his veto .	( 3 ) The aid-to-education bill to which conferees have not yet been appointed . ( 4 ) The minimum wage bills . ( 5 ) The mutual security appropriation bill .

1053	cuba	no_relation	They captured the movement of Lumumba in Congo . They captured the Castro movement in Cuba . They are working to capture other movements in South America .	Why did the people of Ghana and the leadership decide , even though an independent country , even with a great tradition of being tied to the British , even though they had every prospect of maintaining a society tied to the West , why have they in the last 3 years since they have been independent suddenly begun to tie their policies closely to that of the Soviet Union ? It is not chaos . It is not a military seizure of power like Cuba . Yet , Mr. Herter said 3 weeks ago that Ghana is supporting the foreign policy of the Soviet Union .

1054	unemployment	no_relation	We are going to have to find in the 1960 's 25,000 new jobs a week for the next 10 years if we are going to maintain full employment in the United States . And even when we have done that , there are still those eddies , still those islands of unemployment , because of technological changes , because of many conditions . And you have seen it in southern Illinois , and I saw it in the textile towns of Massachusetts , and I spent a month in it with West Virginia and in Kentucky and parts of Pennsylvania .	So part of it requires a local effort and part of it requires a State effort and part of it requires a national effort . I believe the next President of the United States should sign the following bills , and if I am elected I will do so : 1. The area distress bill , a bill which put the credit and power and vigor of the economy of the Federal Government in those areas where unemployment is higher than 7 or 8 percent for a long period of time . In other words , the Federal Government will loan its credit to businesses that wish to come to areas such as this , will provide vocational retraining for older workers , provide supplemental unemployment compensation benefits for those who are out of work for a long time , will aid in cleansing the rivers , will aid in trying to bring new industry into this area .

We fight it now in the sixties .	When income goes down and the cost of living goes up , who is hit the hardest ? 1. Next to those who ca n't find any work at all , those on an inadequate unemployment compensation or public assistance payment , the hardest hit by the job-price squeeze are those Americans who are forced to work for substandard wages . This year the Democratic Party tried to raise the minimum wage to $ 1.25 an hour , to $ 50 for a 48-hour week . Mr. Nixon opposed this measure .	Kennedy_November_2_1960	Kennedy_October_27_1960

What could be more important than health care for our older citizens and for ourselves ? And the answer is being around to enjoy all these good things . So I say to you today that the most important decision you will make on November 8 is this : Which of the candidates for the Presidency , for the Vice Presidency , can best furnish the leadership that will keep the peace for America without surrender and extend freedom throughout the world ? [ Applause .	He 's had some of the same problems that President Eisenhower has had , and he 's handled them with superb skill and superb dignity , and I congratulate him for it . For example , the very quick way that he went to work on asking the legislature to provide for West Virginia 's participation in the new program for medical care for the aged . This is typical of a man of action , a young , vigorous leader of West Virginia .	Nixon_September_28_1960	Nixon_September_27_1960
1057	disarmament	support	I 'm confident of what America can do in the years ahead , provided that Americans know the problems , face up to the challenge , and stay true to the principles that have made this country great . Now , if I might turn to one other point that I think should be covered on an occasion like this , what should be our diplomatic policy in these years ahead ? Diplomatically , the United States , as the President indicated at Baltimore this morning , must always be ready and willing to sit down at the conference table and discuss disarmament , to discuss any differences that we have with any other nation in the world , because we must work for peace constantly ; but on the other hand , let 's remember , as the President also said this morning , when it comes to disarmament we must never forget that we can take nothing on faith , because America must never give up any of its own strength unless we know that the potential enemies of freedom and of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time . In other words , we can have disarmament only with inspection , with the guarantees which the President has insisted upon and which we will insist upon in the next administration as well .	I have those who have written to me and said ,  Now , Mr. Nixon , you 're a Quaker , you believe in peace . Why is it that you stand against the proposals for disarmament that are made by Mr. Khrushchev ? Why is it that we ca n't go more than halfway on these proposals and take some of them on faith ?  I want to tell you why we ca n't . Because if the United States ever enters into a disarmament agreement with the Soviet or with any other potential aggressor which they might break and which we would keep , that would increase the danger of war rather than reduce it and that we must never do .

1058	medical care,health care	no_relation	[ Laughter . ] If we are educating our children by giving them the best education we can , and it is a sober fact that 10 years ago we were turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union , and now one-half as many - if we are going to educate our children , providing full use of the capacity of our plants and men and potential of our industries in the United States , providing medical care for the aged tied to social security , some kind of security to our older citizens , if we are providing opportunity for all citizens to advance their potential , then we are building a strong and vital society here at home , and then we speak with purpose around the world . The strongest force of the United States throughout the world rests with a strong and growing and vital society here in the United States .	It amounts , for a family of four people , to $ 6.50 for a family of four , which amounts to a grand total of 5 cents per person per day , in the richest country on earth . If you feel that a minimum wage of $ 1.25 is extreme , if you believe that medical care for the aged tied to social security is worse than a medical aid bill which requires that an old person must take an oath that he is medically indigent , a pauper 's oath , before he gets public assistance , if you feel it is proper to veto two depressed area bills , if you are pleased by the fact that we built this year in September 30 percent less homes than a year ago , and that this administration has vetoed two housing bills in the last 12 months , if you think that is good , Mr. Nixon is your man .

1059	unemployment	no_relation	I think for the last 8 years we have had a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference . As long as there are 15 million Americans living in substandard housing , as long as the average unemployment compensation check for workers thrown out of work in this country is $ 32 a week , as long as there are millions of Americans who do not even receive the inadequate $ 1 an hour minimum wage , as long as the average check for laundry women in five large cities of this country is 65 cents an hour for a 48-hour week , as long as there are 4 million families receiving a food surplus package from our Government every month , so long is there need for the Democratic Party . [ Applause .	The problems of that New Frontier are felt around the world - and they are felt right here in this valley . Some of the problems are old - the problems of old age and sickness and unemployment . Some of the problems are new - the problems of automation , expanding populations and the missile gap - problems of fair treatment for our farmers and fair distribution of our water .

President Truman used to have a sign which says ,  The Buck Stops Here .	I ask your support on Tuesday . I ask your help in building a stronger country here , providing educational opportunity for our children , in providing jobs for our people , in providing medical care for our older citizens , tied to social security , in providing opportunity for all men and women of talent to build their society here in the United States that will serve as an example of freedom .

It is not only medical care for the aged . It is minimum wage , it is housing for the elderly , public housing .	We only need a few more . A shift of only four votes would have given us a decent bill to provide medical care for the aged under the social security system . And next January we will have those votes .

1065	disarmament	no_relation	A recent independent survey concludes , and I quote it accurately ,  The only continuous features of our efforts in the disarmament field have been a lack of continuity in top personnel and a paucity of planning and research effort .  As a result , we have been unprepared at every disarmament conference that we have attended . At a time when our relative military strength was at its height , in the mid fifties , at a time when we had the best chance to reach an agreement on control of arms , there was not a single top person in the entire Government working on this subject .	He criticized administration farm vetoes . He stressed , and I quote him ,  The necessity for the restoration of cordial relations with Latin America  and he called for more effective action against disarmament . The Democratic nominee in 1928 spoke 30 years ago tonight about building a stronger America , strengthening not only our economy but our sense of moral purpose and our public duty .

These nations know that we are against communism , but they want to know are we also for the people .	He does not see the President , the Prime Minister or the Foreign Minister . The Soviet Ambassador is the second most powerful man in Cuba today .

But instead relies on building cells within those countries , playing on the hostility to us , playing in some cases on our indifference to the problems of the people , playing on their poverty and disease and ignorance , playing on our wealth , playing on our sense of comfort , playing on the inadequacy on occasion of our representatives abroad , playing on the image of America as no longer a vital , vigorous , moving society , and , therefore , young men on the make turn often in many of those countries to the far left for aid and comfort , and what is true in Cuba is going to be a struggle all over Latin America . Every politician who is out , who seeks power , will decide whether the future lies with us or with the Castros and their running mates .	The decision is yours . Boos , shouts , screams , applause on November 8 you have to make a judgment as to what kind of a country you want , whether you feel what we are doing now is good enough , whether you feel that the prestige and power of the United States in the world is rising fast enough , whether you are satisfied to see the United States - and Cuba , 90 miles from the shores of the United States , dominated by a Communist satellite , whether you are satisfied to see two countries of Africa independent in the last 2 years now supporting the Communist Party , whether you are satisfied to see Laos , upon whom the future of all Indochina may rest , now slipping , tonight , not a year ago , tonight , and the next few days , maybe slipping beyond the Iron Curtain .

A majority of Republicans voted against the minimum wage bill , all but one voted against social security health care for the aged and not one Republican on the House Rules Committee was ready to let adequate education and housing bills come up for final action . ( 2 ) To embarrass the Democratic Party , which can point with pride not only to a more meaningful platform but to the only record of legislative achievement in this field in over three-quarters of a century .	: As chairman of the 1946 encampment of the VFW ; as former commander of the VFW post named after my later brother Joseph P. Kennedy , Jr., Post No. 5580 ; and as a member of the Veterans ' Subcommittee of the U.S. Senate for many years I am particularly sorry not to be able to address your convention in person . I had planned to come to Detroit and only the fact that the Senate is going to vote Tuesday on two of the most important sections of the most important legislation facing us this session - medical care for the aged - at 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., prevents me from coming to your meeting . I am sure you will agree that under these circumstances my responsibility is to be here .	Kennedy_September_1_1960	Kennedy_August_23_1960
1069	unemployment	support	Unemployment is not insignificant to the children of the unemployed who are deprived of decent clothing and a decent diet . Unemployment is not insignificant to an America which desperately needs the skills and labor of all its citizens if it is to rebuild the strength which alone can maintain the cause of peace and freedom in a perilous and changing world . And unemployment is not insignificant to the Democratic Party - which has always pursued a policy of full employment - which has never said that there  must be some unemployment  and which is going to see that there are jobs for all Americans in the sixties .	Now , if you regard those programs as extreme , I believe you should support Mr. Nixon and the Republican Party . But if you believe that you can not have a prosperous town in this State if your agricultural income continues to drop , if you recognize that under the program which Mr. Nixon put forward , which is a continuation of the Benson program , and corn which sold 8 years ago for $ 1.50 sells in this State at 95 cents today , will sell next year at 80 cents , and down and down it will go , because this administration 's farm program provides for a free market price , and the free market price for corn in this country with unlimited production will take that down at least 20 percent below what it is selling at today , and if any merchant in this State feels he can prosper with corn on the downward trend , with unemployment in this State , at 6.8 percent to 7 percent , any merchant in this country who feels he can move forward when steel production is at 50 percent of capacity , which it is in the United States , when 7 out of 8 International Harvester plants in Illinois closed down in the last 2 weeks , and they may open some of them in October - if that is the kind of country you want and that is the kind of economy you believe in , if those are the programs you want , I believe you should vote for Mr. Nixon . But if you believe it is time this country moved forward , if you believe we have stood on dead center long enough , if you believe that the balance of power in the world should shift in our direction instead of against us , if you believe that the United States should be first - not first but , if , sometimes or perhaps , but first , period .

It is a source of concern to me that this Government has had less than 100 people scattered through the entire Federal Government working on the subject of disarmament . I would put more people into it .	We have shown very little interest in their health , welfare , and economic problems . Third , I think the United States should put greater emphasis on disarmament .

1071	cuba	support	Mr. Nixon himself was in Latin America 5 years ago and here is what he said :  If we had produced economic progress in Cuba we might have averted the Cuban takeover .  Why did n't we ? That is what he said a month ago ; why did n't we in 1955 come forward with a program that would have prevented Castro from taking power ? When he was there in 1955 , he said , and you can judge his experience ,  I am convinced that communism has passed its highwater mark in Latin America ,  at a time when the Communists were about to communize Cuba . Our third failure has been our inability to establish contact with the young people of that area that will run the country .	This would n't have happened under Franklin Roosevelt , who warned the Nazis in 1940 to stay out of our hemisphere ; this would n't have happened under Harry Truman who warned the Communists in 1947 to stay out of Greece and Turkey . And this would not have happened in Cuba if the Republican leadership Mr. Nixon represents every step which foresight and experience should have directed them to take - in order to prevent a Communist victory only 90 miles from our shores . I do not know how Mr. Nixon can talk of firmness in view of his party 's record in Cuba .	Kennedy_October_18_1960	Kennedy_October_15_1960
1072	medical care,health care	no_relation	My answer to that is that it is extremely difficult , if not impossible , to put through any program , particularly if the program is controversial and new , if the opposing party uses all of the parliamentary devices that are available to Members of the House and Senate , and if we are opposed by the President of the United States . Now , in the case of medical care for the aged , as I said in my statement , being tied to social security , which I thought was extremely important , as you know in the Senate we secured the support of only one Republican , and we were informed by the minority leader , Mr. Dirksen , when the matter came to a vote , that if we passed social security , it would be vetoed by the President . In the case of the $ 1.25 minimum wage , which was my bill , which we did pass in the Senate by a vote of 2 to 1 , we failed in the conference with the House , after Mr. Dirksen , the minority leader , announced that the President of the United States would veto any bill that had $ 1.25 minimum wage .	Yet that is just what we have been urged to do . When all the vague generalities are stripped away , nothing more is being offered by opponents of the Anderson amendment than an increase in the public assistance program to provide some increased medical care for the indigent . The committee bill does improve our public assistance to the most needy .	Kennedy_September_3_1960	Kennedy_August_23_1960

Only one Senator voted with us in the U.S. Senate , Senator Case of New Jersey , a Republican , so that record is very clear .	Kennedy_September_14_1960	Kennedy_September_7_1960
1075	cuba	no_relation	Yet we have done almost nothing to keep Castro from consolidating his regime and beginning subversive activities throughout Latin America . In fact , our prestige in Latin America has fallen so low that - at the recent Inter - American Foreign Ministers Conference - we were unable to persuade our former good neighbors to pass a resolution even criticizing Cuba by name . Now , 2 years later , following blunder after blunder , defeat after defeat , the Republicans decide to combat communism by cutting off exports long after the time has passed when such a move might have had a really significant impact - long after our Cuban exports have declined drastically - and long after , as Mr. Nixon must privately recognize , Mr. Castro himself had already embarked on a deliberate program to cut down American exports .	But if that is what the American people want , if they want to close in and let the future pass them by , take Mr. Nixon . But if you want to move again , if you want this country to meet its responsibilities , if you have confidence that there is nothing we can not do , once given the opportunity to do so , if you believe that people want to be free as they do , that Khrushchev and Castro and the rest of them represent a system which is as old as time , domination of one man by another , which goes against the grain of every person whether they live in the Soviet Union or whether they live in Cuba - they want to be free .

I select it because I believe it is the most important issue not only of this campaign , but of our time , of our generation , of this country . I select it because I know that the people of this State as the people of the other 49 States of the Union , want leadership which will continue to do what President Eisenhower has done , and for which the American people will be forever grateful to him , leadership that will keep the peace , keep it without surrender , leadership that will extend freedom , extend it without war , leadership which will make us proud of our Nation in the council of nations , leadership in which the President of the United States , when he goes to the United Nations , as a man of dignity , standing for disarmament , standing for progress , standing for helping the unfortunate people of the world , and gaining respect rather than making a fool out of himself as did Mr. Khrushchev when he was there at the United Nations - and I know that everybody in this audience , everybody listening to me on television and radio , recognizes that the problems are difficult , difficult not because of our choosing , difficult not because of the other peace-loving nations - and , fortunately , my friends , they are most of the nations in this world , our allies in Europe and in Asia , the so-called neutrals in Africa , and in South America , and in other countries . Certainly in this period we realize that the problems are difficult only because there is on the loose in the world a great aggressive force , a force which is fanatical which is ruthless , whose leaders do not follow the rules of international diplomacy , as we would like them to be followed , whose leaders - and I know them , and I speak from knowledge - are men who have one objective , and one only , and that is to conquer the world , conquer it without war , if they can , but willing to use any means , if that becomes necessary , and because when we have this kind of leadership , aggressive , always probing , always attempting to embarrass , always moving against us around the world , the period ahead is going to be a difficult one .

We have not only gone an extra mile - we have gone an extra 5 miles - on the tests , on disarmament , but on everything else , but every time we come to a blocking point , the blocking point is no inspection , no inspection .	And all that I can say : We can be thankful that our President is n't making a fool of himself as Castro and Khrushchev have at the United Nations . We can be thankful that our President is putting out real disarmament proposals rather than phony ones , that he 's standing for the peace of the world , rather than to stir up trouble in the world , that instead of muscling into the Congo to try to take it over , he 's standing with the United Nations . I say that it 's time , with all this criticism of the President and his policies , that , in pointing out , as we should , the things that are wrong , that we recognize the things that are right about America as well .

Now , in talking to those points , I want to first say that certainly there is no issue that is more important than the one that I mentioned last , because we can have the best jobs and the best education ; we can have the best medical care that we can possibly imagine , and it is n't going to make any difference if we are not around to enjoy it . Now , I simply think it 's time for us to lay it on the line with regard to what the record is insofar as keeping the peace is concerned , because sometimes our memories are pretty short .

And , now , if I may turn to one final point , and I mention this particularly to this group here , because there are some students here : Necessarily , in a campaign we have to discuss what we term the so-called hard issues in terms of foreign policy , specific issues like Cuba , Quemoy and Matsu , Lebanon , et cetera , and there is a tendency for Americans to forget the really important asset that we have in this great struggle in which we 're engaged .

Why have you stated that I support a minimum wage which  official studies show would force unemployment and business failures  when there are no such studies , just administration assertion that this might happen - assertions like those made by Republicans every time an increase in the minimum wage is proposed ? 10 . Why do you blame the present huge agricultural surpluses on the policies your party inherited , when the fact is that at the end of the Truman administration total farm surpluses were valued at $ 2.5 billion , while the present value is $ 8.5 billion ? I have received today a report from Mayor Richard C. Lee , of New Haven , Conn .	Mr. Nixon leads a party which in 1935 voted 99 percent against the 25-cent minimum wage .

For we know that while you may bring a man back from outer space , you rarely bring one back alive from Siberia .	 It is impossible for us to provide for the disarmament of outer space , the disarmament of nuclear weapons , unless we are in a position of parity with the Soviet Union .

I think that we have many arms in the arsenal , and one of course is that , and we should keep that second to none . Secondly , I hope that we can try to work out with our adversaries , the Communists , a realistic system with inspection for the lessening of arms tension , for the cessation of nuclear tests and for the beginning of disarmament , and lift that heavy burden from us all .

People have often spoken to me and they have said ,  Why ca n't we be more flexible in our dealings on disarmament ? Why ca n't we find a bold new program in this area which will make it possible for the Soviet Union to agree ?  And the answer is , of course , that the United States has gone the extra mile in disarmament time and time again .

I have pledged myself and my party to the immediate enactment of a program of medical care for the aged through social security - a soundly financed program without a degrading pauper 's oath and with adequate benefits . And if I am elected President next Tuesday , that pledge will not be filed away with old and unmeant campaign promises ; it will be at the very top of my agenda for action .

Why was the candidate for the Presidency of Brazil in the recent election - why did he feel compelled in the middle of his election to pay a journey to Havana and call on Mr. Castro ?

On the issues on which we are divided with the Soviet Union , disarmament and Berlin , which are the two chief ones at the present time , there is no indication that there is a common meeting ground . Therefore , just to meet , just to sit down , just to spend an hour , unless there is some basis for hope , particularly as Khrushchev is being extremely belligerent now , I thought the President showed good judgment .	The negotiations on nuclear testing are as far apart as they ever were . The talks on disarmament have been called off .

Mr. Khrushchev has stated that he is going to make a special appeal to them . We are going to have a discussion of disarmament .

We did not do as well as I thought we should have done .	The bill has two major purposes . First , it will raise the minimum wage now received by 2 1/2 million workers from $ 1.10 to $ 1.25 an hour . Second , it will extend the protection of the Fair Labor Standards Act to 5 million additional employees , chiefly in large-scale interstate retail and service industries , thereby guaranteeing these employees a fair minimum wage and a just premium for overtime .

I do n't say that life will be easy if we are successful , but I certainly can assure you that we are going to move this country and move ahead .

And growing unemployment and declining production tend to confirm this prophecy . Much of this growing decline in our relative economic strength has been due to Republican failure to realize that a growing economy requires bold and imaginative use of the tools of economic policy and of our abundant resources if that growth is to be maintained and stimulated .	I have no doubt that the men of little faith who lead the Republican Party will criticize this goal as utopian and unrealistic . Such criticism comes easily to a party whose candidate has said that  unemployment is inevitable  - a party which has allowed the unemployment rate to soar to 5.7 percent - a party which has presided over a continual decline in our rate of economic growth .

As long as this administration refuses to pass a minimum wage of $ 1.25 an hour , as long as this administration vetoes housing bills , as long as this administration refuses to pass legislation for medical care for our older citizens , as long as there is not equality of opportunity for all Americans regardless of their race or their religion , there is unfinished business for our generation . I stand here where Harry Truman stood and Franklin Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson in this century .	 But Mr. Nixon and the party he leads say they are content , just as they have always been content , in the face of poverty and unemployment and an America with its most urgent needs unmet . The Republican Party which Mr. Nixon leads today is the same Republican Party which for half a century has opposed every single progressive measure which the Democrats have designed to improve human welfare and reduce human misery - the party which fought against the New Deal and tried to block the Fair Deal - the party which , in the past 8 years has voted aid to areas of unemployment , blocked efforts to improve unemployment compensation , opposed raising the minimum wage , refused to expand the distribution of surplus food to the hungry , and failed to offer one single program to increase the welfare of the American people .

Third , to that end , we will repass , and I would sign , the depressed-areas bill twice vetoed by the Republicans .	I had one of them in my own State , Lawrence , Mass . , where the unemployment rate was 35 percent for 3 years , and the reason , of course , was because we lost our textile mills .

We have held out our hands of friendship to the people of Latin America before we had to , where we did it at our own free will rather than at the point of Castro 's pistol ? We go now and offer a program of Africa to the United Nations . We offer a program of aid ; We offer scholarships to the Congo .	No.2, until our relations with Cuba became so sour that we broke off the sugar quota , the United States almost ignored the needs of Latin America for long-term capital . The authorization which Congress passed in August for the benefit of Latin America was directly tied , unfortunately , in the minds of many Latin Americans as well as in the minds of many Americans , to our troubles with Cuba . Therefore , you have people in Latin America as I said earlier today , running for office , as they are in Brazil , and their platforms are un-American .

Here it was shooting from the hip , but missing the mark , the President taking the correct position of quarantining Mr. Castro , quarantining him by economic and political means , and Mr. Kennedy then saying this is n't enough , we 've got to go further and then making the outrageous suggestion that the Government of the United States should intervene directly - and that 's the way it was interpreted all over the world - into Cuba .	I am sure many of you who are listening tonight or viewing this program saw that debate , and you recall there that I and my opponent had a sharp disagreement . I stood with the President 's program with regard to Cuba .

I have confidence in this Nation 's ability to look out for its older citizens , to see that they have a decent pension and a decent home and decent medical care . The people who oppose this program for medical care under social security are the very same people who fought President Roosevelt in 1935 , the very same people who supported Alf Landon in his campaign in 1936 , running on the single platform of repealing social security .	We can go back to the August session of this Congress when there were three bills , which I think tell very well what the issues are in this campaign . One was medical care for the aged tied to social security . Forty-four Democratic Senators supported it , only one Republican , and it is a fact that in the last 7 days the Governor of this State , a Republican , has attacked the program which was passed in this last session of the Congress , because it was not tied to social security .

These nations know that we are against communism , but they want to know are we also for the people .	Everywhere I go in this campaign , I find people asking : What 's the matter with America ? Why are we slipping , why are we losing friends around the world ? Why are we losing the lead to Russia ? Why are n't we meeting the Communist challenge - from Cuba to the Congo , from India to Indonesia ? Four years ago the cold war was being carried on thousands of miles away .

First , it has been suggested that it is your objective to pose as a champion of disarmament . You are said to be bringing new disarmament proposals with you .	The peace requires that we have these adequate defenses - I know this Nation can afford them - and you know this Nation can not afford to be without them .

1140	minimum wage	no_relation	We were not as successful as I hoped we would be . But I think the real difficulty is the fact that on the two bills which were most controversial , the $ 1.25 minimum wage , and the aid to the aged and social security , we were informed in both cases that if those bills passed , the President would veto them . All the President has to do to stop action is to veto any bill and he needs , according to the Constitution , only one-third plus one of either body to sustain his veto .	He made this motion to table at a time when we had unlimited time to consider the measure . These bills - housing , education , medical help , and minimum wage - are vitally important to millions of American - Negroes and whites because they affect all those Americans who are on the lower level of our economic ladder . I strongly support civil rights and I am wholeheartedly committed to the implementation of the platform , but to use civil rights at this time as a method of defeating other bills whose passage are also essential would have meant that the session would have ended in complete failure .

And what would that have meant ? It would have invited the very kind of intervention from abroad that could have brought war to this hemisphere and to the world .	Because , if any President - let 's assume Mr. Kennedy had been President had apologized to Mr. Khrushchev , Khrushchev , would have beaten him to a pulp , and we ca n't have a President doing that with Khrushchev or anybody else .

Well , in eastern Kentucky the problem is comparable to the problem in West Virginia and the other States , where coal has brought in new machinery and automation has taken the jobs of men . I believe that the best program that we can put forward , as I suggested in my speech , was the so-called area redevelopment bill , which provides loans to small business , which provides loans and grants to communities to provide fresh water , which provides assistance for vocational retraining to train men for new jobs , loans for small businessmen at low rates of interest , supplemental unemployment compensation .

It is the President of the United States that can set the goals for the country in housing , minimum wage , social security , unemployment compensation , and in equality of rights for all Americans , regardless of their race or color . I stand in direct succession to Truman and Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson , who advanced the right of all Americans to participate equally in our society .	 But Mr. Nixon and the party he leads say they are content , just as they have always been content , in the face of poverty and unemployment and an America with its most urgent needs unmet . The Republican Party which Mr. Nixon leads today is the same Republican Party which for half a century has opposed every single progressive measure which the Democrats have designed to improve human welfare and reduce human misery - the party which fought against the New Deal and tried to block the Fair Deal - the party which , in the past 8 years , has vetoed aid to areas of unemployment , blocked efforts to improve unemployment compensation , opposed raising the minimum wage , refused to expand the distribution of surplus food to the hungry , and failed to offer one single program to increase the welfare of the American people . But Americans will not forget Mr. Nixon 's party this November - and they will return the Democrats to leadership so that all Americans can share in American abundance .

And I really do n't think that we 've made enough progress , for example , in the area of disarmament in the last years . We 've only had about 100 people working in the entire Federal Government on the subject of disarmament , the subject of nuclear testing .	We are already racing from the jet age to the space age before meeting the safety , airport development , and other problems of the former . Space exploration that unravels the secrets of our universe , reconnaissance satellites that can replace a hundred U-2 planes watching over all the world , civilian travel in space vehicles , and the rule of law and disarmament in space itself , all these lie ahead of this generation . But we need not look only to the skies for new horizons .	Kennedy_November_2_1960	Kennedy_October_29_1960

But Americans will not forget Mr. Nixon 's party this November - and they will return the Democrats to leadership so that all Americans can share in American abundance .	I am proud of this support . I know that the American labor movement wants for America what I want for America : the elimination of poverty and unemployment , the reestablishment of America 's position of leadership in the world , the end of racial discrimination everywhere in our society . I know the American labor movement opposes what I oppose : complacency , unemployment , economic stagnation , and national insecurity .	Kennedy_September_19_1960	Kennedy_August_30_1960

I want a $ 1.25 an hour minimum wage , medical care for the aged through social security , Federal aid to help raise teachers salaries as well as schools , an adequate program of slum clearance and low-rent housing , and a program of aid to areas of chronic unemployment which would include northern Minnesota . These are my goals .	Quite obviously they did in both the House and Senate . But if you take the minimum wage conference as I said yesterday , every Democrat participating in that conference but one voted for the $ 1.25 , every Republican participating in that conference except one voted against it .

And even when we have done that , there are still those eddies , still those islands of unemployment , because of technological changes , because of many conditions . And you have seen it in southern Illinois , and I saw it in the textile towns of Massachusetts , and I spent a month in it with West Virginia and in Kentucky and parts of Pennsylvania .	[ Applause . ] Every program which we now put forward and which both parties now endorse was written into the statute books over the opposition of a substantial group of the Republican Party , things which make life decent for all Americans , a chance for social security , for minimum wage , for unemployment compensation , for public housing .

Why do n't we send the Marines in ? My friends , the reason we do n't is that we do n't want to make a second Hungary out of 5 million people on the island of Cuba . The reason we do n't is that we know the people of Cuba will take care of this or any other dictator in their good time if they get the moral support of the United States . So , the President said : We will quarantine Castro .	The President was right , right because no President can ever apologize for defending the security of the United States against surprise attack . And then , my friends , the third point you will recall if you heard our last debate , was on Cuba where he said the President was n't going far enough , and where he , in effect , advocated policies that were universally interpreted as meaning intervention in the affairs of Cuba . And what would that have meant ? It would have invited the very kind of intervention from abroad that could have brought war to this hemisphere and to the world .

Those are the issues which separate the two parties .	I do n't take his view about [ applause ] - I do n't say that $ 1.25 minimum wage is extreme .

Are n't we being too rigid ?  And I can only say I have seen these proposals over the years , and the United States could not have been more tolerant . We have not only gone an extra mile - we have gone an extra 5 miles - on the tests , on disarmament , but on everything else , but every time we come to a blocking point , the blocking point is no inspection , no inspection .

We want a peace in which the world is not teetering constantly on the brink of war . We want a peace in which the funds now poured into the destructive forces of armaments may be channeled into the constructive results of disarmament - into great multi-Nation efforts to eradicate disease , harness rivers , eliminate illiteracy , and exploit the frontiers of space .

We say that the answer to the problem of health care for our old people is our way and not theirs . Why ? Because ours is a program which leaves to the individual the choice , the choice of what he wants in the way of protection .	Physicians and scientists in fields closely allied to medicine have told me how they are already probing below the level of the body 's cells and have begun to explore the molecules in the cells - the fundamental area where both normality and disease are controlled . We are , therefore , now in a position to further this mounting scientific attack upon disease and health problems by broad general programs directed toward the support of research , training of medical , dental , and other health manpower , and expansion of health care facilities . This will not be simple or easy .	Nixon_October_3_1960	Nixon_October_2_1960

The point is : the Soviet Union is blocking the road to disarmament , blocking the road to stopping tests . Why ? Because they want a closed society and they want no inspection .	We have to have the power because we are friends of peace . As long as America is the strongest nation in the world , the world need not fear that there will be war , because we will use our strength to keep peace , and I think that all of you , including those who are as dedicated to peace as I am , will say that we want the next President of the United States always to go the extra mile , as President Eisenhower has , to negotiate with Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else for disarmament . We want to go the extra mile to strengthen the United Nations and the instruments of peace , but under no circumstances do we want the next President to be a man who will be fooled , who will make concessions to them without getting concessions in return , and , above all , we do not want the next President to be one who will reduce the strength of America unless we 're absolutely sure that the enemies of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time .

I believe the Democratic Party has a responsibility .	I believe that we can divide , generally , the responsibilities which we will meet in the sixties into two categories . The first of those is to attempt to bring up to date those pieces of social legislation passed in the 1930 's which still have great significance in the lives of our citizens today , and , therefore , while Franklin Roosevelt could propose in 1935 a 25-cent minimum wage , we proposed in 1960 a $ 1.25 minimum wage . Where Franklin Roosevelt proposed social security in 1935 , we propose in 1960 medical care for the aged tied to social security .	Kennedy_October_23_1960	Kennedy_October_16_1960
1169	medical care,health care	no_relation	We can go back to the August session of this Congress when there were three bills , which I think tell very well what the issues are in this campaign . One was medical care for the aged tied to social security . Forty-four Democratic Senators supported it , only one Republican , and it is a fact that in the last 7 days the Governor of this State , a Republican , has attacked the program which was passed in this last session of the Congress , because it was not tied to social security .	Others can be financed through closing tax loopholes and better enforcing our tax laws . Some programs - such as medical care for the aged and self-liquidating power projects - are not a burden on the taxpayers . Above all , I am convinced that a nation on the move , growing at a more rapid rate than we have for the past eight years - with more people working and more industries operating at full capacity - will produce far more revenues without an increase in taxes .

1170	unemployment	no_relation	And in both 1958 and 1959 , an average of more than 1 million idle workers remained out of a job for more than 15 week - the highest number since before the war . These figures tell a human story - the story of unemployment benefits running out - of 3 million Americans force to live on an unhealthy , tasteless diet of surplus foods - a story of hardship and personal tragedy . What , then , does Mr. Nixon mean when he says we are enjoying the greatest prosperity that Americans have ever enjoyed ? Perhaps he believes that if only 1 out of every 10 Americans are unable to find full-time work , the other 9 out of every 10 must be doing all right .	[ Applause . ] * * * We must act and act promptly - to solve the problem of automation which threatens millions of Americans with technological unemployment . We can do this in several ways .

1171	unemployment	support	Those three points . Mr. Nixon denied all of them , and now , in the last 2 months , in the last 2 weeks , one , we are , according to the figures released yesterday , we have more unemployment than we had in the recession at this time since 1958 ; two , we are going to have more cars unsold by the middle of November , 1 million of them , 1 million unsold cars , the largest inventory in the history of the United States . Three , we have lost since June $ 1 billion of the $ 18 billion that backs our currency which has moved abroad ; four , in the last 2 months , the administration 's figures on the amount of income that would be received from tax purposes from our economy has dropped between $ 3 and $ 4 billion .	I think that you know the issues of this campaign well . There is no community in the United States in the last 2 or 3 years that has learned a harder lesson of what it means to live under a Republican administration [ applause ] and an administration which has permitted unemployment in this community to double in the last 12 months .

1173	minimum wage	no_relation	I do n't mean that they have not come up with new legislation . The fact of the matter is that every piece of major legislation which is the hallmark of Franklin Roosevelt 's administration from social security to minimum wage , from the Securities and Exchange Act to TVA , every one of those pieces of legislation was opposed - at the time they were written - by the Republican Party . They say our goals are the same .	The nature of the employer 's business is irrelevant . Thus , there may be two employees , working side by side in the employ of the same employer , one of whom is protected by the statutory minimum wage and one who is not . For example , a wholesaler 's order clerk who typed orders for goods purchased out of State would be entitled to the statutory minimum , but the billing clerk at the next desk who typed bills for customers inside the State would lack the same protection .

India hangs in the balance .	The administration was not concerned about the problem of providing for free elections and democracy in all of Latin America and sooner or later dictatorships lead to control of the national movement by the Communists . It happened in Iraq , it happened in Cuba , it will happen any place . Anyone who feels that you can do business with a dictator year after year because he is going to vote with you in the United Nations , sooner or later the Communists will gather control of the opposition movement and when he goes they will seize control .

Do they think that Mr. Khrushchev gains prestige for the Communists when he takes off his shoe at the United Nations and pounds the table with it ? I say no. I say that President Eisenhower gained prestige for America when with great dignity and great responsibility , he stood for peace , for disarmament , for all the things that Americans believe in. No , my friends , the real test of prestige , if our prestige was low , I can assure you , would occur in the United Nations , and there what do we find ? In every instance where we 've had a test vote - and listen to this - in the last 7 years , with the Soviet Union on one side and the United States on the other , we have won ; and in the vote on the Congo we won , 70 to nothing .

1179	minimum wage	support	Put your thumb down regardless of what you do . We are fighting a candidate , the Republican Party , that for 20 years has opposed what the people need , minimum wage , housing , unemployment compensation . The real issue is which party and which candidate can best strengthen the United States , can best serve the public interest .	First , those of you who are active in labor , those of you who lead organized labor movements , are concerned about the welfare of your people and concerned about the welfare of the general public , and you know very well , perhaps better than anyone , that this country still has unfinished business , that we have to maintain full employment , that we have to advance the standards of living of our people , of better housing , of better minimum wage , of medical care for the aged . Franklin Roosevelt could put forward a minimum wage of 25 cents an hour in 1935 , but that does not mean the job was finished . Ninety percent of the Republicans could vote against 25 cents an hour in 1935 just as they voted against $ 1.25 minimium wage in 1960 .	Kennedy_October_20_1960	Kennedy_October_19_1960
1180	medical care,health care	support	A further Federal - State program should be inaugurated at once , designed to help rehabilitate handicapped persons who may never again be able to accept regular employment but who can be brought to the point where they need not be dependent on custodial care . Many older people in hospitals and nursing homes today could care for themselves in the proper setting , if the combined forces of medical care , social service counseling , and other resources were brought to bear on their handicaps . Additional Federal funds should be made available for research and training in the field of rehabilitation , with special emphasis on rehabilitation of older people .	We 're not going to because the American people recognize that good times are with us today and that they can be better tomorrow . So , if we 're not going to have a recession , how about our programs for progress for the future ? Well , here , as you might expect , the voter again is confronted with a real problem , because I say that I have programs that will produce progress , better schools and better housing for all Americans , a program of medical care for the aged , a program that will expand job opportunities for all of our people ; a program in the field of civil rights that sees that all Americans move forward together , leaving none behind .

1181	medical care,health care	no_relation	The real question for our time is : Can we make a free society develop , grow , thrive , with sufficient purpose , sufficient direction , to compete with the single-minded advance of the Communists over a long period of time ? That is the problem that all of us face as Republicans and Democrats . My disagreement with this administration is that it has not set our goals high enough , that it has not provided the means and the mechanism by which we can meet the problems that we face , whether it is education whether it is housing , whether it is medical care for our older citizens , whether it is employment for our people , whether it is the development of natural resources , whether it is the building of strength throughout the world . Today , Latin America , Africa , and Asia hang on the razor edge of decision to decide which road they will take .	[ Response from the audience . ] I want someone to tell me a single piece of domestic legislation that Mr. Nixon ever proposed that stood for progress for the people , from minimum wage , social security - this summer we tried to pass a bill for medical care for the older citizens . Under the bill , which the President signed , before you or your mother and father , who may be retired , who may have a heart attack or cancer or sick for several months - before they can get any assistance under that program , they first have to sign a petition that they are medically indigent .

This gives an idea of the choice .	Do we want that from our President ? No. Our President goes before the United Nations . He comes out with an honest program of disarmament . Not one which is naive , because , as the President says , America must never disarm unless we have guarantees that the Khrushchevs and the others will also reduce their armaments at the same time .

Now , if they get sick , if the husband gets sick or the wife gets sick , maybe sick for 3 or 4 months , they run up doctors ' bills and medical bills in the hundreds of dollars , they have to rely on their savings or they have to rely on their children , and sometimes their children are already hard pressed to maintain their own families . What we suggest is that medical care for the aged be tied to social security , every working American contribute , and it 's little less than 3 cents a day during their working years .

1184	unemployment	no_relation	Here the Wabash and Ohio Rivers drain the heartland of America , an area rich in resources , an area ideally located to serve the markets of the Midwest , and an area with a skilled , determined and vigorous people . But in the past 8 years the Republican Party has transformed this potential wealth , this Valley of Opportunity , into a Valley of Lost Opportunity , a valley of increasing unemployment , and mounting poverty , a valley of decreasing income and lost jobs . Indiana has lost 33,600 manufacturing jobs in the past 8 years , and the Nation as a whole has lost 1 million jobs .	I consider that waste , too . There are many kinds of waste , and I think it is the function of government to use our resources to the fullest , to use our natural and material and human resources to the fullest , to educate our children , to build a stronger economy , to provide medical care for our aged under social security , to use to the fullest those areas of the United States where unemployment has been chronic for a great many years , to use our brains and our energy to build a stronger and better society here in the United States .

1185	medical care,health care	support	Thank you . In New York , Thursday , Senator Kennedy said that the position of the Republican Party is that  we can not afford medical care for the aged .  Once again , Senator Kennedy is trying to mislead the American people by telling them that Republicans are opposed to medical care for the aged .	We 're going to have to have more in the field of education . We 're going to have to have a better program in the field of medical care , but my friends , the reason why my programs are better for America than those of my opponent is this . That his would turn all of these problems over to the Federal Government , they would cost an amount equal - get this - each year to almost the entire gold reserve of America that 's in Fort Knox , and do you know what that means to you ? It means higher prices , higher taxes for the American people .	Nixon_October_29_1960	Nixon_October_28_1960

These are the traditional issues , old but still new , and I believe that the next President and the next Congress must meet their responsibilities in this field .	Behind that sign up there [ laughter ] - behind that sign I hear that there is a slogan  Experience counts .

The strongest force of the United States throughout the world rests with a strong and growing and vital society here in the United States .	I say to cut back on hospitals is downgrading America . They tell us we 're well off ; then they tell us we ca n't afford to provide our older citizens with a decent program of protection against the heavy cost of medical care . The Republican administration forced upon us a program which refuses medical care to any retired person or his wife , unless they sign away their home , their car , and take a pauper 's oath .

We must always go the extra mile working for peace , for disarmament , but , above everything else , we must recognize our purpose , our mission in the world . I say this particularly , because this is a college town .	They would use it because their aim is to conquer the world . So , my friends , let me say this : We will work for disarmament , yes . We will work to stop tests and get an agreement , yes ; but we will never agree to anything unless we are sure they are going to keep the bargain because that 's how America has got into trouble in the past , and we are not going to make that mistake in the future .

1189	disarmament	no_relation	Winston Churchill said 11 years ago ,  You can not negotiate successfully with the Communists unless you do so from a position of equality .  One of the reasons we have been unable to secure an effective disarmament policy in outer space was because the Soviet Union was ahead of us and they said they would not agree to any disarmament of outer space unless we also abandoned our bases overseas , because they said they would be giving up their lead . In other words , maintaining a position of equality permits you to negotiate more successfully .	We have shown very little interest in their health , welfare , and economic problems . Third , I think the United States should put greater emphasis on disarmament . Fourth , I think it has been the greatest blow we have had in the 1950 's or since World War II , when the United States was second in space .	Kennedy_September_23_1960	Kennedy_September_17_1960
1190	minimum wage	support	Mr. Nixon represents a party which has opposed progress - for many years . He represents a party which voted 90 percent against a 25-cent minimum wage in the midthirties , and voted 90 percent against $ 1.25 minimum wage in 1960 . He represents a party which has opposed the strengthening of our educational system , which has opposed medical care for our older citizens tied to social security , which has brought recession in 1954 , again in 1958 , and has brought us to an economic slowdown in the vital year of 1960 .	 Today the Fair Labor Standards Act , with its guarantee of a decent minimum wage , has become an established feature of the American economic System but in 1937 a leading Republican Congressman warned that  if you pass this bill * * * gone with the wind is our democratic system of government and all the institutions we hold dear .  Other Republicans attacked minimum wage as  communism  and the  road to economic hell  - 93 percent of the Republicans in Congress voted to kill the bill calling for a 25-cent minimum wage and the Republicans have opposed every increase in the minimum wage ever since . Today the Social Security Act is regarded as the most important and beneficial single piece of social legislation in American history .	Kennedy_November_6_1960	Kennedy_October_30_1960

Thirdly , I would hope that the United States could make for effective judgments of the events that are going to occur .	You have defied and hamstrung the United Nations in the Congo . Yet you now come talking of disarmament . Under the old English legal maxim ,  He who seeks equity must come with clean hands ,  and you do not come to the United States , Mr. Khrushchev , with clean hands .

We 're always going to be willing to go the extra mile to negotiate disarmament or anything , but we 're never going to fall into the fatal error of what has got us in war in the past and that is let dictators think that we will not react . So , this is the way to peace , and I want you to know that we will have no greater obligation than to keep the peace for ourselves , for our children , and also to see to it that our children have an opportunity to grow up and have a better life even than we 've had .	I see him , ruthless , tough , completely a man dedicated to one purpose only - the evil purpose of conquering the world , and this is what I know . If America ever makes the mistake of entering into a disarmament agreement , which he does not also keep with inspection , it will increase the danger of war rather than reduce it , and I 'll tell you why : We can not leave to a man who is the enemy of peace power to start a war and destroy the world . We have to have the power because we are friends of peace .	Nixon_October_28_1960	Nixon_October_22_1960
1195	medical care,health care	support	Can you tell me anything more wasteful than that ? So the minimum wage does not cost anything . Medical care for the aged is financed under social security . Far more wasteful is the bill which was finally passed which would cost $ 2 billion a year , $ 1 billion by the Federal Government out of the Treasury , and $ 1 billion by the States , and before anybody gets any assistance they have to take a pauper 's oath before they can get any assistance , if they are over 65 .	Every 4 years the Republican candidate for the Presidency says it does n't matter which party wins , we are all for the same things , we are all for the same goals . Well , if we are all for the same goals , why did the Republicans defeat our efforts to provide a minimum wage of $ 1.25 , and medical care for our aged citizens , and Federal aid to education , and housing to rebuild our cities ? Our goals are not the same , nor are the means the same , nor have they been since Theodore Roosevelt . A Democratic Party sees the government and the people working together for a stronger and better country , for , in Paul Douglas ' words , a juster America .

1196	minimum wage	support	Cuba is important but so are our relations with the Soviet Union , the problems of Latin America , Africa , and Asia . Equally important are the domestic issues which you and the Republican Party seem to wish to bury during this campaign - minimum wage , medical care for the aged , aid to education , and the rising rate of unemployment ; only a week ago you stated you were going to talk about Quemoy and Matsu every day for the final 3 weeks of the campaign . Now it is Cuba .	Mr. Nixon leads a party which in 1935 voted 99 percent against the 25-cent minimum wage . And Mr. Nixon last week said $ 1.25 minimum wage is inflationary . I would like to see any American get along who lives in political life , from the President , Vice President , to the two candidates , on $ 1.25 an hour .

1197	medical care,health care	no_relation	After passing in the Senate of the United States a bill for aid for education , and a bill for aid for housing , we failed to get both of those bills to the floor of the House of Representatives for a vote , and every Republican member of the Rules Committee of the House voted against them going to the floor of the House of Representatives . We failed to secure passage of a bill connected with the Forand bill , tying medical care for the aged to social security . Instead of the bill that was finally passed we received the support of one Republican Senator , Senator Case of New Jersey , and we were threatened by a Presidential veto .	 Mr. President , I join with the Senator from New Mexico in urging the Senate to adopt the amendment I have cosponsored with him . Of the alternatives offered , it best meets the needs of the aged for medical care . This proposal extends to 9 million of our elder citizens a life policy of paid-up medical insurance .

1198	disarmament	no_relation	We can not parley on the basis of equality with the Soviet unless we maintain a military position of equality with them , and that goes in the traditional weapons and in missiles and in outer space . One of the reasons why we have never been able to get an agreement on the disarmament of outer space is because we are second in outer space , and the Soviet Union will not give way their advantage . We arm to parley , and we must be strong if we are going to disarm and maintain our security .	In 1952 , during the campaign between Adlai Stevenson and Dwight Eisenhower , there was no discussion , really , of outer space , and yet this administration , when a similar opportunity was granted to it to make a significant breakthrough , to recognize the implications of the opportunity in the same way that Franklin Roosevelt had recognized it in 1941 , when this administration was informed of the significance of outer space , both militarily and scientifically , we did not respond . My judgment is that we did not respond there as we have not responded to our needs in Latin America , our needs in Africa , our needs in Asia , our needs in disarmament , our needs in arms , because this administration has not been able to attract people of intellectual vitality , curiosity , foresight , and vigor .

First , he may have some new proposals on disarmament which he hopes to capture the attention of the world with . Second I think he thinks that the General Assembly of the United Nations is going to be increasingly influential and powerful .	Mr. Khrushchev has stated that he is going to make a special appeal to them . We are going to have a discussion of disarmament . But I do think that in the final analysis that the President should make a judgment as to whether he should attend the United Nations .	Kennedy_September_17_1960	Kennedy_September_3_1960
1201	unemployment	no_relation	The raising of the minimum wage and its extension to cover millions of unprotected American workers must be one of the first items on the agenda of the next administration . Our unemployment benefits , too , must be standardized and extended . By assuring working Americans of a living wage , by assuring unemployed Americans that they will be able to have the basic necessities of life , we help not only New England against substandard competition ; we help the entire Nation .	History disproved them . On each of these three occasions increases for sharper than those we propose today were put into effect without injury to employees , inflation , or unemployment .

As I said , we did secure the passage in the Senate of the minimum wage 2 to 1 , which was a bill that I sponsored . We missed on medical care for the aged in the Senate only by five votes .

1204	cuba	no_relation	We must be strong in purpose , we must be strong in leadership , we must be strong militarily , and we must be strong economically . It is no accident that the Communists have made their greatest gains from Laos to Cuba to Africa , during the period when our relative strength was in decline , when 1 out of every 16 Americans is unemployed , when 1 out of 20 who is employed is forced to work part time , when great industries like steel are barely working half of their capacity , when , for 7 years , our farmers have been caught in a cruel squeeze between ever-increasing rises in their costs and a decline in their prices , which has caused them to be the most oppressed group in the American economy , when mining is depressed , when lumber production is double and transportation is down , and the cost of living goes up . Mr. Khrushchev confronts us at the United Nations with arrogant confidence , because he believes that the economy of the Soviet Union and the Communist bloc is growing at a faster relative rate than is ours .	, said :  There are those who are going around the country crying 'doom and gloom , ' but we just built the largest shopping center in the world .  I am not satisfied to have the largest shopping center as long as the Soviet Union is moving in Latin America , Asia , and Cuba . I think we can do better ; that is the question before us in 1960 .

1205	unemployment	no_relation	There are a billion more people crowding our globe , and every American can hear the rumbling of a distant drum . The next President will have a budget 25 times as large as that of the candidates in Al Smith 's time , and he will face problems unprecedented in that time or in any time in our long history , automation and unemployment , farm surpluses and food shortages , a high cost of living in the midst of an economic slump , new nations , new leaders , the world is different across the street and on the other side of the moon . The white race is in the minority , the free-enterprise system is in the minority , and the majority are looking at us harder and longer than they ever looked before .	The figure prior to this was 8 percent , which had 8 percent over a period of a year or 18 months . I believe that that program could be useful in using defense contracts most of which are not by bid but which are negotiated , to put those in areas where it is possible , where there is chronic unemployment and little hope for new industry . I would feel both of those , plus the coal research bill , plus the national fuels policy , I believe all of those would be of assistance in eastern Kentucky and these other hard-hit areas .

1206	medical care,health care	support	From now until November 8 we are taking our ease to the forum in which it belongs , where there is no threat of veto , where there is no parliamentary obstruction , and where we will be successful - and that is the forum of the American people . Until a Democrat is in the White house , the Republicans can block action on an adequate minimum wage , they can water down medical care for the aged , they can play politics with civil rights , they can block action on a decent housing bill and a good school bill . But they can not block the American people on November 8. The theme of this campaign is going to be action - action at home to keep pace with our growing needs , to help the unfortunate , to build a still greater nation - and action abroad , to match the rise in Communist power , to meet the turbulent revolutions reshaping our globe .	The kind of a meeting that we had today indicates , I think , that partnership which can exist between the farmers of this country and the Federal Government . Senator John F. Kennedy tonight expressed keen disappointment on the defeat of the Anderson - Kennedy amendment to the medical care to the aged bill .  I am sure that the threat of a White House veto mentioned by every speaker opposing the amendment contributed to this defeat .	Kennedy_September_3_1960	Kennedy_August_23_1960

The Government should directly aid the anti-Castro forces in and out of Cuba . And a storm of protest arose all over the Americas , in the United Nations ; and , so , the next day he said : I did n't mean it that way .	And the third point - and this is what I call shooting from the hip - the difficult problem in Cuba , this little pipsqueak , Castro , down there stirring it up ; and , so , everybody says ; Why do n't we get rid of him ? Why do n't we send the Marines in ? My friends , the reason we do n't is that we do n't want to make a second Hungary out of 5 million people on the island of Cuba . The reason we do n't is that we know the people of Cuba will take care of this or any other dictator in their good time if they get the moral support of the United States .

She 's been moving .	Now what can be done ? Here 's my answer : I say that in this field we want first to be sure that we maintain what we have today , and you know what it is ? The best medical care in the world . We do n't want to do anything that reduces the standard of our medical care . We want to be sure that we do n't put our doctors , for example , on the Federal payroll .	Nixon_October_14_1960	Nixon_October_12_1960

In Venezuela angry mobs have assaulted the Vice President of the United States .	He praised the competence , and I quote him ,  and stability of the Batista regime .

Under discussion will be ways and means of creating more jobs to take care of the growing unemployment problem throughout the Nation . Specific attention will be given the problem of long-term chronic unemployment in 177 areas throughout the Nation , the Senator said , but the conference will address itself mainly to the larger problem of jobless workers wherever they may be .

1211	unemployment	no_relation	But in our effort to create a growing America - an America which will someday provide a job for every man who wants to work - we must not forget about those who are out of work today . We need to enact Federal standards of unemployment compensation so that jobless men can receive benefits adequate to allow them to obtain at least the basic rudiments of existence . We need to offer a richer and more varied diet to those forced to live on surplus foods .	There have been two recessions within 7 years , and there are economists who believe a third is coming . Unemployment is dangerously high even on the national average . Workers in many important industrial communities have been still more seriously injured .

1212	disarmament	support	I believe that this country can do more for peace than it has done . I am not satisfied to have only 100 experts scattered through the U.S. Government working on the sensitive and complex issue of disarmament . I regret that our negotiators at previous disarmament conferences too often have been ill prepared , ill advised , and ill staffed .	We want a peace in which the world is not teetering constantly on the brink of war . We want a peace in which the funds now poured into the destructive forces of armaments may be channeled into the constructive results of disarmament - into great multi-Nation efforts to eradicate disease , harness rivers , eliminate illiteracy , and exploit the frontiers of space . We want a peace in which we can truly beat our swords into plowshares , our bombs into reactors , and our rockets into vehicles for exploring outer space .

1214	cuba	no_relation	Here again we see the President taking the line that we will quarantine Castro , and we 're doing it economically and politically , and that will have the effect that everybody wants to see , that the Cuban people have the opportunity to have freedom . And yet here again my opponent made a suggestion which throughout the world , in every paper supporting him in this campaign , even in the United States , was interpreted as meaning advocating Government intervention in Cuba . What would that have meant ? It would have meant an open invitation for civil war , an open invitation for the Communists to come in. But then others say to me ,  But , Mr. Nixon , he did n't mean it .	Now , how does our opponent compare in this field ? All I can say is this : On three great issues - the Formosa Straits , the President 's conduct at the summit conference , when he refused to apologize to Khrushchev , as he should have refused to apologize to him --- [ Cheers and applause . ] And then on Cuba - Senator Kennedy has said one thing , President Eisenhower has said another - President Eisenhower has been right , Senator Kennedy has been wrong - and the American people know it .

1215	disarmament	no_relation	The next President must promptly send to the Congress a special message requesting the funds and the authority necessary to give us a nuclear capacity second to none , making us invulnerable to any attack , and have conventional forces so strong and so mobile that they can stamp out a brush fire war before it spreads . Only then can we get Mr. Khrushchev and the Chinese Communists to talk about disarmament , because having the second best defensive hand in the 1960 's will be like having the second best poker hand . [ Applause .	But the hard facts of the matter are that we have fewer than 100 people in the entire Federal Government working on these problems . And the result has been that this country has not been prepared for any disarmament , arms control or atomic testing conference that has taken place since the end of the Korean war . I have proposed in the Congress the establishment of a National Peace Agency - an Arms Control Research Institute - and the next President of the United States must take this step to pave the way for peace .

1216	unemployment	no_relation	And unemployment is not insignificant to the Democratic Party - which has always pursued a policy of full employment - which has never said that there  must be some unemployment  and which is going to see that there are jobs for all Americans in the sixties . In fact , unemployment is only insignificant to Mr. Nixon and a Republican Party which has opposed every Democratic effort to put men back to work in the past 8 years - which has complacently stood by while unemployment rose from less than 2 million in 1952 to 4 million today and while Michigan lost more than 100,000 jobs despite an expanding population . For I believe that the American people are going to reject a party which - again in Mr. Nixon 's words - believes that  unemployment is inevitable ,  a party which lacks faith in the capacity of a strong and growing America to provide jobs for all its people , a party which , in the most fundamental sense , is letting America run down because it is failing to build America up , a party whose candidate is all too ready to threaten war but is unwilling to build up the strength which is the only guarantee of peace , who is always willing to speak loudly , but is unwilling to be sure that America carries a big stick .	Senator John F. Kennedy today declared that-- the midyear budget report shows our fiscal stake in full employment . Rising unemployment and slack business conditions will cause a loss of at least $ 2 billion in anticipated revenue-- Kennedy said . The failure of corporate profits to rise and the consequent loss of expected corporate tax collections has caused a substantial change in the budget picture .

1217	unemployment	support	And behind the statistics are people . I have seen in West Virginia and Pennsylvania what unemployment means . It means hungry children - families unable to afford decent clothes or a decent home to live in. Let us face facts : We will not have full employment and rapid economic growth in America without positive policies to get it .	But the burden which should concern us most lies upon the American conscience . We can no longer tolerate growing patches of poverty and injustice in America - substandard wages , unemployment , city slums , inadequate medical care , inferior education and the sad plight of migratory workers . The enactment of this bill is only one step , but an essential step forward , as we cross this frontier to grasp the high opportunities which face the Nation .

I select it because I believe it is the most important issue not only of this campaign , but of our time , of our generation , of this country . I select it because I know that the people of this State as the people of the other 49 States of the Union , want leadership which will continue to do what President Eisenhower has done , and for which the American people will be forever grateful to him , leadership that will keep the peace , keep it without surrender , leadership that will extend freedom , extend it without war , leadership which will make us proud of our Nation in the council of nations , leadership in which the President of the United States , when he goes to the United Nations , as a man of dignity , standing for disarmament , standing for progress , standing for helping the unfortunate people of the world , and gaining respect rather than making a fool out of himself as did Mr. Khrushchev when he was there at the United Nations - and I know that everybody in this audience , everybody listening to me on television and radio , recognizes that the problems are difficult , difficult not because of our choosing , difficult not because of the other peace-loving nations - and , fortunately , my friends , they are most of the nations in this world , our allies in Europe and in Asia , the so-called neutrals in Africa , and in South America , and in other countries . Certainly in this period we realize that the problems are difficult only because there is on the loose in the world a great aggressive force , a force which is fanatical which is ruthless , whose leaders do not follow the rules of international diplomacy , as we would like them to be followed , whose leaders - and I know them , and I speak from knowledge - are men who have one objective , and one only , and that is to conquer the world , conquer it without war , if they can , but willing to use any means , if that becomes necessary , and because when we have this kind of leadership , aggressive , always probing , always attempting to embarrass , always moving against us around the world , the period ahead is going to be a difficult one .

1220	minimum wage	support	This summer , when we tried to improve the standards of social security by providing medical care for the aged tied to social security , again the great majority of the Republicans , over 90 percent , voted against medical care for the aged tied to social security . Eighty percent of the members of the House of Representatives who are Republicans voted against the $ 1.25 minimum wage , $ 50 a week for a 40-hour week for an industry , a business , that makes more than a million dollars a year . How can anybody live on it ? No Member of the Congress could .	First , those of you who are active in labor , those of you who lead organized labor movements , are concerned about the welfare of your people and concerned about the welfare of the general public , and you know very well , perhaps better than anyone , that this country still has unfinished business , that we have to maintain full employment , that we have to advance the standards of living of our people , of better housing , of better minimum wage , of medical care for the aged . Franklin Roosevelt could put forward a minimum wage of 25 cents an hour in 1935 , but that does not mean the job was finished . Ninety percent of the Republicans could vote against 25 cents an hour in 1935 just as they voted against $ 1.25 minimium wage in 1960 .	Kennedy_October_21_1960	Kennedy_October_19_1960
1223	unemployment	no_relation	That may have been all right in those times when we had full employment . Farmers could farm and work in the cities and towns , but this year we have the highest unemployment that we have had in any months of August and September , the three Augusts and Septembers preceding the recession of 1949 , 1954 , and 1958 , and this district knows this problem well , because this district has lost 60,000 people in the last 10 years . The failure of this administration to support the area redevelopment bill which has passed the U.S. Senate three times , introduced in the Senate by Senator Douglas , supported strongly by your Congressman , I think has made it more difficult for this district and districts in my own State of Massachusetts and in West Virginia and in Pennsylvania and in Kentucky , to lift themselves off the ground .	In other words , the Federal Government will loan its credit to businesses that wish to come to areas such as this , will provide vocational retraining for older workers , provide supplemental unemployment compensation benefits for those who are out of work for a long time , will aid in cleansing the rivers , will aid in trying to bring new industry into this area . We will , if we pass defense manpower policy No.4 again , steer defense contracts into those areas with a high level of unemployment . 2.

Fourth , we will strengthen our planning the preparation for disarmament . One of the most glaring failures of the past 8 years has been our failure to prepare properly for any arms control conference since the end of the Korean war .	The generation for which I speak has seen enough of warmongers - let our great role in history be that of peacemakers . But the harsh facts of the matter are that in three vital areas we have been ill-staffed and ill-represented in the struggle for peace - in our disarmament planning , in our diplomatic and foreign service , and in our technical assistance to underdeveloped nations .

If he had said that when he was President of the United States , the trouble that would have been caused simply could n't be imagined .	This is another case of your speaking first and thinking afterward - a habit which is a very dangerous one for a man who is asking the American people to select him as Commander in Chief of all the Armed Forces of this Nation . If your original statement on Cuba had been intended only to cover what you now claim in your telegram to the effect that we should  let the forces of freedom in Cuba know that we believe that freedom will again arise in their country  you would have been advocating what has been the policy which the administration has been following for months .

But Mr. Nixon and the party he leads say they are content , just as they have always been content , in the face of poverty and unemployment and an America with its most urgent needs unmet . The Republican Party which Mr. Nixon leads today is the same Republican Party which for half a century has opposed every single progressive measure which the Democrats have designed to improve human welfare and reduce human misery - the party which fought against the New Deal and tried to block the Fair Deal - the party which , in the past 8 years , has vetoed aid to areas of unemployment , blocked efforts to improve unemployment compensation , opposed raising the minimum wage , refused to expand the distribution of surplus food to the hungry , and failed to offer one single program to increase the welfare of the American people .	Sixth , we must revise our outmoded unemployment compensation laws to allow men to receive full benefit payments while they are engaged in retraining programs . Seventh and finally , we must restore full employment to our schedule of national priorities - striving - for a more rapid growth of the American economy - building purchasing power through better minimum wage and unemployment compensation laws - having faith in America 's capacity to eventually provide a productive job for every man who wants to work . This is our program - a program which can help transform the threat of automation into the promise of abundance - a program which will require leadership inspired by both compassion and courage - a program which will require from labor , management , and Government a willingness to accept new concepts , new burdens and new risks to meet the challenge of automation 's new frontier .

1232	unemployment	no_relation	Every piece of important legislation of benefit to our people was opposed by the Republicans when they first came into being , away back to the Federal Reserve Board , all the reforms of the Roosevelt administration , social security , all the others , minimum wage , housing , benefits to the farmers , all opposed . Now , with that long history , TVA , the development of our resources , all in opposition , with that long history , how can we expect that that party and that candidate can move this country ahead , with all the changes coming on , the prospects for unemployment , the recession possibly this winter in 1961 , with our farm income down 25 percent , with 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls never seeing the inside of a college , who graduate from high school , our prestige in the world being affected , with Communists on the march , Castro on the march . I believe the United States has to make a decision .	Sixth I have tried in this campaign to demonstrate my confidence in the American people , in their ability to listen to facts , not name calling , to judge the candidates on their own views , not someone else 's coat tails , to remember the records of the two parties , and not ignore party labels , to hear what is said in one section alone . It is because I have this confidence in you that I do not share my opponent 's fear of the future , his fears of every new program his fears that inflation and deficits and unemployment are unavoidable , his fear that we can not afford what we must afford , or even his fear of a fifth debate . In short , I have tried in this campaign to set forth my responsibilities - and yours as well .	Kennedy_November_7_1960	Kennedy_November_4_1960
1233	cuba	no_relation	Yet we have done almost nothing to keep Castro from consolidating his regime and beginning subversive activities throughout Latin America . In fact , our prestige in Latin America has fallen so low that - at the recent Inter - American Foreign Ministers Conference - we were unable to persuade our former good neighbors to pass a resolution even criticizing Cuba by name . Now , 2 years later , following blunder after blunder , defeat after defeat , the Republicans decide to combat communism by cutting off exports long after the time has passed when such a move might have had a really significant impact - long after our Cuban exports have declined drastically - and long after , as Mr. Nixon must privately recognize , Mr. Castro himself had already embarked on a deliberate program to cut down American exports .	But in 8 short years that bright heritage , the heritage of 20 Democratic years , has been largely dissipated and destroyed , and much of the good will , which it took two decades to build , has been lost . In Cuba the Communists have gained a satellite and established a base for the attempted infiltration and subversion of all Latin America . In Venezuela angry mobs have assaulted the Vice President of the United States .	Kennedy_October_20_1960	Kennedy_October_18_1960
1234	unemployment	no_relation	But from my trip on that occasion and from my information as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , it seems to me that there are three areas where the United States should strengthen itself , and I think this city has a particular role to play in that strengthening . If you have unemployment here , it is not only citizens who want a job who ca n't find work ; there are some of the most highly skilled people in the United States whose skills as a team and as individuals could be dissipated . Therefore , I think the United States should make a greater effort in the field of missiles , first ; secondly , it should do a greater job and a better job in the field of developing an airlift capacity - nearly all the planes that took the U.N. forces to the Congo were American planes , but most of them were planes which are becoming obsolete and they contrasted in some cases to the jets which the Russians and the British used for transportation of U.N. personnel - and thirdly , I think that we should strengthen our retaliatory capacity , the traditional manned bomber , unless the United States is prepared to give up the lead in this vital form of national defense and national security .	History disproved them . On each of these three occasions increases for sharper than those we propose today were put into effect without injury to employees , inflation , or unemployment . The fancied dangers were never realized .	Kennedy_September_11_1960	Kennedy_August_10_1960
1235	minimum wage	no_relation	Can you tell me what , in the last 25 years , what program the Republican leadership ever suggested that served the people ? [ Response from the audience . ] Housing legislation and social security ? Minimum wage ? All of the programs that serve our people , that advance our country , that provide this country with vigor and vitality , education , security for our aged citizens under medical care under social security , all these programs have been initiated by the party which we lead in this campaign . And as you look at the sixties and recognize the need for new resolutions to new problems , I ca n't believe that this country will entrust the leadership to a candidate and a party that have opposed progress in the last 25 years .	Farmers will manage their own production , will limit their own marketing through such devices as marketing quotas , marketing orders and agreements , Government purchases , crop loans , and so on - an individual farmer-managed program tailored to each individual crop . With the price of milk fat today at only 80 percent of parity , the labor earnings of dairy farmers are less than the national minimum wage . Governor Nelson has taken an active role in formulating a dairy program .	Kennedy_October_30_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
1236	minimum wage	support	When income goes down and the cost of living goes up , who is hit the hardest ? 1. Next to those who ca n't find any work at all , those on an inadequate unemployment compensation or public assistance payment , the hardest hit by the job-price squeeze are those Americans who are forced to work for substandard wages . This year the Democratic Party tried to raise the minimum wage to $ 1.25 an hour , to $ 50 for a 48-hour week . Mr. Nixon opposed this measure .	I believe that we can divide , generally , the responsibilities which we will meet in the sixties into two categories . The first of those is to attempt to bring up to date those pieces of social legislation passed in the 1930 's which still have great significance in the lives of our citizens today , and , therefore , while Franklin Roosevelt could propose in 1935 a 25-cent minimum wage , we proposed in 1960 a $ 1.25 minimum wage . Where Franklin Roosevelt proposed social security in 1935 , we propose in 1960 medical care for the aged tied to social security .	Kennedy_October_27_1960	Kennedy_October_16_1960
1238	unemployment	no_relation	And in both 1958 and 1959 , an average of more than 1 million idle workers remained out of a job for more than 15 weeks - the highest number since before the war . These figures tell a human story - the story of unemployment benefits running out - of 3 million Americans forced to live on an unhealthy tasteless diet of surplus foods - a story of hardship and personal tragedy . What , then , does Mr. Nixon mean when he says we are enjoying the greatest prosperity that Americans have ever enjoyed ? Perhaps he believes that if only 1 out of every 10 Americans are unable to find full-time work , the other 9 out of every 10 must be doing all right .	But from my trip on that occasion and from my information as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , it seems to me that there are three areas where the United States should strengthen itself , and I think this city has a particular role to play in that strengthening . If you have unemployment here , it is not only citizens who want a job who ca n't find work ; there are some of the most highly skilled people in the United States whose skills as a team and as individuals could be dissipated .

1240	medical care,health care	no_relation	But our goals are not the same . I want a $ 1.25 an hour minimum wage , medical care for the aged through social security , Federal aid to help raise teachers salaries as well as schools , an adequate program of slum clearance and low-rent housing , and a program of aid to areas of chronic unemployment which would include northern Minnesota . These are my goals .	This year again the Republican Party - as it always has in the past - is fighting every single Democratic effort to advance the welfare of our people to relieve poverty and hunger and the burdens of illness . This year again only a single Republican in the Senate voted for medical care for the aged . This year again Mr. Nixon , as the spokesman for his party , speaking to 73 million people in our television debate , said that our efforts to provide medical care through social security were  extreme .

1241	unemployment	no_relation	[ Applause . ] On television this afternoon he repeated one of the oldest , tiredest stories of the Republicans , that $ 1.25 minimum wage would cause massive unemployment . That is the same old story that they used to tell in the thirties when the Democrats and Franklin Roosevelt first wrote in a minimum wage of 25 cents an hour .	I think that you know the issues of this campaign well . There is no community in the United States in the last 2 or 3 years that has learned a harder lesson of what it means to live under a Republican administration [ applause ] and an administration which has permitted unemployment in this community to double in the last 12 months .

1242	cuba	support	As a matter of fact , my friends , on every one of these three instances his friends and supporters say : But , Mr. Nixon , he changed his mind . He 's now for the President on Cuba . He now says that the President did the right thing in Paris .	Now he says he really did n't mean it that way . He disagreed with the President on Cuba , but now he says his position is really about the same as the President 's . Over and over again , we find him saying one thing one day and another thing another day , as soon as he reads the polls or hears the people .	Nixon_November_5_1960	Nixon_November_4_1960
1243	minimum wage	support	The third point on which we differ is in the record of our party , and the promise that that record gives to the future . Ninety percent of the Republicans voted against a 25-cent minimum wage in 1935 , and 90 percent of them voted against the $ 1.25 an hour in 1960 , which Mr. Nixon considers extreme . Ninety percent of the Republicans voted against the social security in the midthirties and 95 percent in 1960 voted against the medical care for the aged tied to social security .	Put your thumb down regardless of what you do . We are fighting a candidate , the Republican Party , that for 20 years has opposed what the people need , minimum wage , housing , unemployment compensation . The real issue is which party and which candidate can best strengthen the United States , can best serve the public interest .	Kennedy_November_1_1960	Kennedy_October_20_1960
1244	cuba	no_relation	We have participated in the discussions leading to these great decisions , and as far as the record is concerned , we are part of it ; we are proud of it , and I think that the American people know what we will do when a crisis comes . As far as our opponent is concerned , I would only suggest this : We have a pretty good idea what he would do , too , and , based on what he has said in this campaign , how he disagreed with the President on Quemoy and Matsu , how he suggested that the President could have apologized to Khrushchev at Paris , is almost certainly the most irresponsible proposal ever advocated by a Presidential candidate with regard to Cuba - when you consider these things , I say that we can not afford the inexperience of a man like that as President of the United States . And , of course , some people may well say ,  But , Mr. Nixon , he 's changed his mind about Quemoy and Matsu .	It is true , as you stated in your telegram , that I said that I intended to talk about Quemoy and Matsu every day for the final 3 weeks of the campaign . When I said that I had no idea that you would make even a greater blunder about Cuba . Consequently , I will talk about not only Quemoy and Matsu but also about Cuba every day during the next 2 weeks - I will do this because I am deeply concerned about the policies you advocate in those two areas of the world which might well lead to abandoning free territory in the Far East , and a loss of all of our Latin American allies in this hemisphere or worse .

1245	unemployment	no_relation	This revolution in nationhood has been but one of several other revolutions , all of which have been going on at the same time - and all of tremendous importance to history . There is the revolution in transportation and communication which is shrinking our world with every passing day ; there is the revolution in medicine which is enabling human beings to become healthier and live longer ; the revolution in automation , which increases our abundance , but also our unemployment ; the revolution of farm production , which could bring the eventual elimination of hunger in the world , but which so far has only brought disaster to the farm family ; the revolution of our exploding urban population which brings with it the problems of overerowded schools , urban blight , and crowded slums . There is the revolution in education , which sees more and more of our young people going to college , while two-thirds of the world 's population still remains illiterate ; the tremendously exciting revolution in space , which will soon carry man to other worlds undreamed of ; and the equally exciting and morally refreshing revolution for human rights for all citizens here at home .	But the unpleasant facts are still there . And I can assure you that if Mr. Nixon can travel across this great land and remain indifferent to the problems of unemployment and economic slow-down which afflict many sections of America - problems which he is seeing at first hand - his vision will be no clearer and his awareness no greater from the White House in far-away Washington . For the Mr. Nixon who can look upon your distress - and say all is well - is the same Mr. Nixon who , in the past 8 years , has led the fight against every Democratic measure designed to increase the welfare of the American people - to put men back to work - and to help rebuild the economically distressed areas of America .

1246	disarmament	support	The negotiations on nuclear testing are as far apart as ever . The talks on disarmament have been called off . And , finally , instead of the hoped-for general relaxation of world tension , the Soviets have stepped up their efforts to create disorder , danger and division .	In other words , maintaining a position of equality permits you to negotiate more successfully . It is a source of concern to me that this Government has had less than 100 people scattered through the entire Federal Government working on the subject of disarmament .

1248	cuba	no_relation	[ Applause . ] I have asked Mr. Nixon to participate in a fifth debate which I think should cover the question of Cuba and other important problems facing the American people . I still find it impossible to understand why Mr. Nixon wants to limit the debate to one subject where there are so many important problems facing the American people .	I was in Cuba in 1957 and the American Ambassador informed me that the American Ambassador was the second most influential man in Cuba . There is not any doubt we had great influence in Cuba , and I think it is unfortunate that we did not use that influence more vigorously to persuade Mr. Batista to hold free , open elections , so that the people of Cuba could have made the choice , rather than holding onto his power and finally driven out by Castro at the point of a gun . Mr. Castro is now a Communist .	Kennedy_October_24_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960

I am proud of the fact that I was endorsed by the AFL - CIO .

1250	disarmament	support	So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war . That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests . Yes , but we will never agree to an agreement unless the Soviet Union is going to require inspection as well as the United States .	We know what peace demands . We will always go the extra mile to strengthen peace , the extra mile to work for disarmament , the extra mile to reduce tensions , but we will always remember that the man we are dealing with and his colleagues are ruthless , fanatical aggressors and that they do not follow the rules of the game that we would like them to follow , and that we must treat them the way they are , and this means that we must never make a concession without being sure that we 're getting one in return , that we must never agree , for example , to disarmament unless we can be sure that they , too , are disarming . Why is this necessary for peace ? Because , as I said at my last stop , we 've got to remember that as long as the United States maintains its present position of being stronger than anyone who threatens the peace of the world we can be the guardians of peace ; but the moment that somebody or some nation that does not want peace - in other words , that would use war as an instrument of conquest - is stronger than we are , or thinks they are , then peace is no longer safe .

It 's true that President Eisenhower is n't making a fool of himself on the floor of the U.N. It 's true that he is advocating a program for disarmament , for the use of outer space , a program in addition , for the use of our surpluses through the United Nations . All of these are honest , decent proposals , which the whole world applauds .	Nixon_October_6_1960	Nixon_October_3_1960
1252	cuba	no_relation	Thus far these fighters for freedom have had virtually no support from our Government .  This clearly means , as the New York Times Washington correspondent , James Reston , reported in today 's paper :  His statement this week on Cuba , publicly calling for Government aid to overthrow Castro , is a clear violation of the inter-American treaty prohibition against intervention in the internal affairs of the hemisphere Republics .  Thus it is clear that you and I are diametrically opposed on a matter of great public interest and one which the next President may have to deal with as soon as he assumes the office .	They can say we ca n't object to the Soviet Union moving into Cuba under the Monroe Doctrine - we could at the present time - if the United States is attempting to intervene and move into the internal affairs of Cuba . Let 's suppose the Soviet Union does move into Cuba . Suppose they do move in to help Castro .	Nixon_October_23_1960	Nixon_October_22_1960
1253	disarmament	support	Now , if I might turn to one other point that I think should be covered on an occasion like this , what should be our diplomatic policy in these years ahead ? Diplomatically , the United States , as the President indicated at Baltimore this morning , must always be ready and willing to sit down at the conference table and discuss disarmament , to discuss any differences that we have with any other nation in the world , because we must work for peace constantly ; but on the other hand , let 's remember , as the President also said this morning , when it comes to disarmament we must never forget that we can take nothing on faith , because America must never give up any of its own strength unless we know that the potential enemies of freedom and of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time . In other words , we can have disarmament only with inspection , with the guarantees which the President has insisted upon and which we will insist upon in the next administration as well . And in the negotiations that we have , as far as these guidelines are concerned , may I suggest these other things should be remembered as well ; we must be firm in our dealings with the Soviet , as I have indicated , but we must be nonbelligerent .	We have made a good-faith effort to advance the - advance toward disarmament - and make some progress by having a meeting of the Disarmament Commission . Now , when they make a proposal like this , it 's a cynical attempt to prevent progress , that 's what it is it shows that they do n't really want disarmament . Q. Can you estimate how long your disarmament duties will keep you under this self-imposed noncampaigning status ? A. Well , it is n't really self-imposed .	Nixon_September_12_1960	Nixon_August_1_1960

[ Applause .	In 1952 , during the campaign between Adlai Stevenson and Dwight Eisenhower , there was no discussion , really , of outer space , and yet this administration , when a similar opportunity was granted to it to make a significant breakthrough , to recognize the implications of the opportunity in the same way that Franklin Roosevelt had recognized it in 1941 , when this administration was informed of the significance of outer space , both militarily and scientifically , we did not respond . My judgment is that we did not respond there as we have not responded to our needs in Latin America , our needs in Africa , our needs in Asia , our needs in disarmament , our needs in arms , because this administration has not been able to attract people of intellectual vitality , curiosity , foresight , and vigor .

He has n't put up a phony disarmament scheme , but he 's been working for atoms for peace and for real disarmament . He has stood for great moral leadership in the world , and this has been good for America , and it has meant that our prestige , rather than being at an alltime low , as people have suggested , is high today , and in the United Nations it 's particularly high , and if we have any doubts about it , look at that vote on the Congo a few days ago .	That 's what we 've been doing and that 's what we 're going to continue to do . It is n't as spectacular as President Eisenhower has done to go before the U.N. and to lay it on the line for controlled disarmament - not phony disarmament - not where you simply have empty pledges , but a case where both sides will disarm . Because remember this : If we ever have disarmament where we disarm and the other side does n't , that means that we increase the risk of war rather than reduce it , and we 're not going to do that and we can be sure of that .

1266	disarmament	support	We must never make a concession to them without getting a concession in return . As President Eisenhower has said , the United States wants disarmament . We are willing to make all kinds of proposals for disarmament , but we are never going to disarm unless we are sure that the Soviet Union is also disarming at the same time through inspection , because if we did we would not be serving the cause of disarmament or of peace .	Now , if I might turn to one other point that I think should be covered on an occasion like this , what should be our diplomatic policy in these years ahead ? Diplomatically , the United States , as the President indicated at Baltimore this morning , must always be ready and willing to sit down at the conference table and discuss disarmament , to discuss any differences that we have with any other nation in the world , because we must work for peace constantly ; but on the other hand , let 's remember , as the President also said this morning , when it comes to disarmament we must never forget that we can take nothing on faith , because America must never give up any of its own strength unless we know that the potential enemies of freedom and of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time . In other words , we can have disarmament only with inspection , with the guarantees which the President has insisted upon and which we will insist upon in the next administration as well . And in the negotiations that we have , as far as these guidelines are concerned , may I suggest these other things should be remembered as well ; we must be firm in our dealings with the Soviet , as I have indicated , but we must be nonbelligerent .

1267	unemployment	no_relation	We are going to have to build a better life for our people . As long as there are 15 million American homes which are substandard , as long as there are millions of Americans who are not even paid a dollar an hour , as long as there are hundreds of thousands of Americans out of work , living on an average unemployment compensation check of $ 31 a week - what do they do when they go out of a job ? Where do they go to work ? How do they keep their families ? How do they pay their rent ? These are the problems that disturb America . How do we maintain our position in the world ? How do we provide fairness and equality of opportunity for all Americans ? I think that on Tuesday my job and responsibility and that of Mr. Nixon 's is over .	I want to make it very clear that the differences between Mr. Nixon and myself , the differences between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party are clear . Mr. Nixon represents a party , a philosophy which he believes in , which voted against social security and minimum wage and housing and unemployment compensation . The fact of the matter is that the Republican Party controlled the Congress and the Presidency for years and no civil rights bill ever saw the light of day .

1268	unemployment	support	First , we must spur the rate of national economic growth so as to take up the slack now existing in heavy industry - such as steel , chemicals , and autos - and in service industries - such as building and construction . Secondly , we must administer existing defense and other Federal procurement programs in a manner that , consistent with the national interest , areas with idle facilities and idle skills are given priority before those skills are disgraced and chronic unemployment takes over . Third , to that end , we will repass , and I would sign , the depressed-areas bill twice vetoed by the Republicans .	This fast-moving technological revolution offers hope of vastly increased productivity - of greater abundance for all Americans . But we must harness it to serve the welfare of our people and not allow it to become an instrument of economic distress and unemployment . In the past 8 years nothing has been done to meet this growing challenge .	Kennedy_September_28_1960	Kennedy_September_27_1960
1269	unemployment	no_relation	Throughout the entire Nation men and women - almost 4 million of them - are looking for jobs . Economists tell us that an unemployment rate of 6 percent is the danger signal . When a community passes that point it is officially regarded as an area of  substantial labor surplus .	Nevertheless , we must recognize that the textile and apparel industries are of international scope and are peculiarly susceptible to competitive pressure from imports . Clearly the problems of the industry will not disappear by neglect nor can we wait for a large scale unemployment and shutdown of the industry to inspire us to action . A comprehensive industrywide remedy is necessary .	Kennedy_September_19_1960	Kennedy_August_31_1960
1270	minimum wage	support	No.2, we went to conference between the House and the Senate on minimum wage . Six out of seven Republicans on that conference voted against that not only the $ 1.25 minimum wage , but also against the President 's own program which we finally offered as a compromise . Six out of seven Democrats on the conference voted for the $ 1.25 minimum wage .	I urge the President to act now . The intentions of the Republicans today was to use civil rights legislation to block the enactment of bills for Federal-aid to education , housing , medical assistance to the aged and the lifting of the minimum wage . The evidence lies in the fact that it was Senator Dirksen himself last April 1 who moved to table the very Government Contracts Commission proposal which he now purports to support .

1271	minimum wage	support	And it was extreme for Mr. Nixon . For he had previously voted to completely remove 1 million workers from the protection of the minimum wage laws and he is the candidate of a party which opposed the first 25-cent-an-hour minimum wage and which has fought against every increase since . 2. The job-price squeeze has also frustrated the ambitions of millions of Americans to buy their own homes .	I do n't think the monetary and fiscal policies which this administration has followed are good enough . I believe that when they stand against the minimum wage of $ 1.25 an hour , I think they are standing in the way of progress . We have high interest rates and as a partial result we built this year 200,000 less homes than we needed in this country to stay up with our population .

1272	disarmament	support	The catastrophic arms race , more costly than all of our budget put together , more costly than all the other things which we pay for , can not be eliminated merely by wishful thinking . But is n't it a somber fact that this administration has had less than 100 people working in the entire National Government on the subject of disarmament One-fifth as many as work for the U.S. Battle Monuments Commission are working on disarmament in this administration - 100 people scattered throughout the international government . And we can not avoid the menace of a Communist base on Cuba , only 90 miles from our shores , merely by wishing it had not happened , though I wish it had not .	Well , it is , Jackie , of course , the great problem . And I really do n't think that we 've made enough progress , for example , in the area of disarmament in the last years . We 've only had about 100 people working in the entire Federal Government on the subject of disarmament , the subject of nuclear testing .	Kennedy_November_4_1960	Kennedy_November_2_1960
1274	minimum wage	no_relation	[ Applause . ] We attempted to pass in the Senate of the United States a bill providing $ 1.25 minimum wage . The average wage for laundry women in five large cities of the United States , and many of them are Negroes , is 65 cents an hour for a 48-hour week .	The nature of the employer 's business is irrelevant . Thus , there may be two employees , working side by side in the employ of the same employer , one of whom is protected by the statutory minimum wage and one who is not . For example , a wholesaler 's order clerk who typed orders for goods purchased out of State would be entitled to the statutory minimum , but the billing clerk at the next desk who typed bills for customers inside the State would lack the same protection .

1276	disarmament	support	So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war . That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests . Yes , but we will never agree to an agreement unless the Soviet Union is going to require inspection as well as the United States .	We have to have the power because we are friends of peace . As long as America is the strongest nation in the world , the world need not fear that there will be war , because we will use our strength to keep peace , and I think that all of you , including those who are as dedicated to peace as I am , will say that we want the next President of the United States always to go the extra mile , as President Eisenhower has , to negotiate with Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else for disarmament . We want to go the extra mile to strengthen the United Nations and the instruments of peace , but under no circumstances do we want the next President to be a man who will be fooled , who will make concessions to them without getting concessions in return , and , above all , we do not want the next President to be one who will reduce the strength of America unless we 're absolutely sure that the enemies of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time .

1277	minimum wage	support	A Republican candidate and a Republican President , representing as he does those interests and members of the Republican Party , must take a particular position on a particular issue . Is it any accident that for the last 25 years the Republicans have voted against the minimum wage nearly every time ? They voted against the 25 cents in 1935 , and they voted against the $ 1.25 in 1960 . They voted against the social security in 1935 , and they voted against the medical care for the aged in 1960 .	These other Republicans refused to accept or work for the $ 1.25 minimum Senate bill or the much milder minimum wage legislation endorsed by President Eisenhower which was contained in the Prouty amendment . While I naturally wanted to see the Senate version of the minimum wage bill enacted into law , I and the colleagues supporting me were willing to accept a reasonable compromise . We supported the legislation recommended by the administration .	Kennedy_October_2_1960	Kennedy_August_30_1960
1278	unemployment	no_relation	First , while I said that the American economy was failing to move ahead fast enough to meet the needs of the Nation or the people , Mr. Nixon said that  We 'd never had it so good ,  that the Nation was enjoying  unexampled prosperity .  Since that time unemployment has risen to more than 6 percent , the highest since the great recession of 1958 . In the past 5 months we have lost almost $ 1 billion of our dwindling gold reserves to foreign banks .	We have urban renewal and housing measures , but to replace slums faster than they are spreading , those measures must be expanded . We have unemployment insurance benefits that need higher nationwide standards , a water pollution control program that needs stepping up , dams that are planned but unbuilt . We have legislation to help our depressed areas of long-term unemployment that needs to be passed again - so it can be signed instead of vetoed .	Kennedy_November_7_1960	Kennedy_November_4_1960
1279	minimum wage	support	 But Mr. Nixon and the party he leads say they are content , just as they have always been content , in the face of poverty and unemployment and an America with its most urgent needs unmet . The Republican Party which Mr. Nixon leads today is the same Republican Party which for half a century has opposed every single progressive measure which the Democrats have designed to improve human welfare and reduce human misery - the party which fought against the New Deal and tried to block the Fair Deal - the party which , in the past 8 years , has vetoed aid to areas of unemployment , blocked efforts to improve unemployment compensation , opposed raising the minimum wage , refused to expand the distribution of surplus food to the hungry , and failed to offer one single program to increase the welfare of the American people . But Americans will not forget Mr. Nixon 's party this November - and they will return the Democrats to leadership so that all Americans can share in American abundance .	I urge the President to act now . The intentions of the Republicans today was to use civil rights legislation to block the enactment of bills for Federal-aid to education , housing , medical assistance to the aged and the lifting of the minimum wage .

We want a future of progress , but above all , the people of this country are concerned that our children may grow up in a world in which we can be free and we can live at peace - and that is the most important thing that Americans must think about at this time . Now , obviously , I know people could say ,  Well , now , just a minute , Mr. Nixon , do you mean that peace and developing policies that will keep peace and freedom are more important that jobs , more important than good medical care and more important than housing and education and the like ?  And the answer is that of course all those things are important too . But we can have all those things and it wo n't do us any good if we 're not around to enjoy them .	 What are the folks going to do ? What are the voters going to do ? Here 's what you do : First , you look at our record and on the record I say you compare the record of the Eisenhower administration with the record of the administration which preceded it . Both have been in for 7 ½ years , and you can take any test you want - schools , housing , medical care , jobs , wages , controlling inflation - and you will find that in this administration we have moved forward ; we have had far greater progress than in the Truman administration . And , so , your choice is : If you want to go back to what we left , you have an easy choice because that 's what our opponents offer .	Nixon_October_12_1960	Nixon_October_10_1960
1281	unemployment	no_relation	 If it remains there it is entitled to special Government help through defense procurement and other programs . But today the unemployment rate for the entire Nation is nearly 6 percent . The whole United States is rapidly becoming an area of substantial labor surplus .	Social security - they voted against it . Minimum wage , housing , unemployment compensation , and in the last session of the Congress in August , when we brought up a bill for medical care for the aged , we received 45 Democrats and 1 Republican who supported it , and we were told it would be vetoed if it passed . I want to say right here that that bill must pass next year , and there will be a President , we hope , in the White house who will not veto it but encourage it .

1282	unemployment	no_relation	And in both 1958 and 1959 , an average of more than 1 million idle workers remained out of a job for more than 15 week - the highest number since before the war . These figures tell a human story - the story of unemployment benefits running out - of 3 million Americans force to live on an unhealthy , tasteless diet of surplus foods - a story of hardship and personal tragedy . What , then , does Mr. Nixon mean when he says we are enjoying the greatest prosperity that Americans have ever enjoyed ? Perhaps he believes that if only 1 out of every 10 Americans are unable to find full-time work , the other 9 out of every 10 must be doing all right .	I would hope that our fiscal and monetary policy would have sufficient vitality to maintain the upward growth of our economy . Within that general sphere I would attempt to maintain a balanced budget and a balance between the funds that come in and the funds that go out , unless there was wide unemployment , or a threat to our security that required the defense expenditure .

We can not do that by arguing with him - and we ca n't do that by smiling at him .

When I said that I had no idea that you would make even a greater blunder about Cuba . Consequently , I will talk about not only Quemoy and Matsu but also about Cuba every day during the next 2 weeks - I will do this because I am deeply concerned about the policies you advocate in those two areas of the world which might well lead to abandoning free territory in the Far East , and a loss of all of our Latin American allies in this hemisphere or worse .

Third - we must begin , perhaps within the framework of the arms control research institute , to plan for the reconversion of our economy from war to peace .	In 1952 , during the campaign between Adlai Stevenson and Dwight Eisenhower , there was no discussion , really , of outer space , and yet this administration , when a similar opportunity was granted to it to make a significant breakthrough , to recognize the implications of the opportunity in the same way that Franklin Roosevelt had recognized it in 1941 , when this administration was informed of the significance of outer space , both militarily and scientifically , we did not respond . My judgment is that we did not respond there as we have not responded to our needs in Latin America , our needs in Africa , our needs in Asia , our needs in disarmament , our needs in arms , because this administration has not been able to attract people of intellectual vitality , curiosity , foresight , and vigor .

Good water , power , transportation , those are necessary to develop the economy of the United States in the 1960 's .

We say that in the field of education we are proud that we stand for a program that will build more schools , that will raise the levels of our teachers ' salaries , but which rejects the program that they have that would endanger the right of the States to control education and that would , in effect , give to the Federal government the power not only to pay teachers , but to tell them what to teach - and that must never happen in the United States of America .

Disarmament today is just as complicated as armaments - involving complex problems of surveillance , reconnaissance , seismography , atmospheric sampling and testing stations .

1308	minimum wage	support	 Today the Fair Labor Standards Act , with its guarantee of a decent minimum wage , has become an established feature of the American economic System but in 1937 a leading Republican Congressman warned that  if you pass this bill * * * gone with the wind is our democratic system of government and all the institutions we hold dear .  Other Republicans attacked minimum wage as  communism  and the  road to economic hell  - 93 percent of the Republicans in Congress voted to kill the bill calling for a 25-cent minimum wage and the Republicans have opposed every increase in the minimum wage ever since . Today the Social Security Act is regarded as the most important and beneficial single piece of social legislation in American history .	They stem from the administration of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman . They are the efforts which Democratic Presidents and Democratic Congresses have made to write into law a whole platform of social legislation , which permits all Americans to participate in our standard of living , minimum wage , social security , unemployment compensation , housing , aid to education , medical care for the aged , all of the great litany of pieces of social legislation for which we are distinguished which make it easy for a Democratic candidate to run for the Presidency , and which Mr. Nixon 's party has opposed . It is our function , however , not to merely invoke the names of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman , not to merely live off what they did , but to bring these old programs up to date .

1309	medical care,health care	support	This last session of the Congress for the last 4 weeks is a vivid example of what can happen when the country is divided in its leadership ; because the Republican Party opposed the $ 1.25 minimum wage , we did n't get it . Because the Republican Party - and only one Senator voted against them - opposed medical care for the aged tied to social security , which had the endorsement of Governor Rockefeller , as well as the Democratic Party , and it was beaten by five votes . And Time magazine this week said that the leader of the Republican Party smiled when he heard the results - this is the kind of thing which has happened in the month of August .	 I am sure that the threat of a White House veto mentioned by every speaker opposing the amendment contributed to this defeat . In addition , it should be noted that only one Republican voted for this sound approach to the medical care for the aged program .  This vote demonstrates that if we 're going to have effective legislation in this and other fields , we 're going to have to have an administration that will provide leadership and a Congress that will act .

1311	minimum wage	support	Fact : When the minimum wage was raised from 40 cents to 75 cents an hour , every Republican on the House Labor Committee opposed it and the Republicans in the House voted 143 to 12 to take away minimum wage protection from 1 million workers who were covered . Fact : In 1960 , the attempt to raise the minimum wage to $ 1.25 an hour was defeated in the House when Republicans voted 119 to 27 against it . In the Senate , the $ 1.25 minimum wage was opposed by the Republicans , 18 to 14 .	I do n't take his view about [ applause ] - I do n't say that $ 1.25 minimum wage is extreme . I do n't lead a party that voted nearly unanimously against 25 cents minimum wage . I do n't go around saying 4.5 million Americans unemployed is insignificant , is necessary .

1312	cuba	no_relation	In 1955 Mr. Nixon went to Cuba to view conditions for himself . But his only reaction was to praise  the competence and stability  of the Batista dictatorship which was , even then , threatened by Communist activities - and to say that  communism has reached its high-water mark in Latin America  at a time when Communist influence was beginning to rise , and only a few short years before the Communists took over all of Cuba . Mr. Nixon saw nothing wrong in Cuba - he made no recommendations for action - he did not warn America that danger was growing - and as a result the Communists took over Cuba with virtually no opposition from the United States .	National independence can not exist without political independence - and want and poverty and hunger are the conditions under which communism feasts and prospers . These are just some of the steps which we must take if we are to succeed in halting the steady advance of communism - an advance which is now on our very doorstep in Cuba . In the novel  On the Beach ,  the lone American survivors of world war III are standing on a beach in Australia , awaiting the inevitable end from the spreading cloud of radioactivity .

But to most of the peoples of the world , that is a far-off battle - compared to their battles against poverty and disease and unemployment and illiteracy . Neither do they share our belief that our way , the private enterprise way , is necessarily the best path for any country under any circumstances .	But the burden which should concern us most lies upon the American conscience . We can no longer tolerate growing patches of poverty and injustice in America - substandard wages , unemployment , city slums , inadequate medical care , inferior education and the sad plight of migratory workers . The enactment of this bill is only one step , but an essential step forward , as we cross this frontier to grasp the high opportunities which face the Nation .

1314	cuba	no_relation	After doing nothing for 6 years while the conditions that give rise to communism grew - after ignoring the repeated warning of our Ambassadors that the Communists were about to take over Cuba - after standing helplessly by while the Russians established a new satellite only 90 miles from American shores - Mr. Nixon and the Republicans , after 2 years of inaction since Castro took power , now attempt to make up for this incredible history of blunder , inaction , retreat and failure , by cutting off several million dollars worth of exports in a move which will have virtually no effect by itself in removing Communist rule from Cuba . In cutting off a carefully limited number of the American goods which can be sent to Cuba Mr. Nixon has made a dramatic but almost empty gesture - a gesture which will have so little impact on Castro as to be almost meaningless . The State Department itself admits that our exports to Cuba have already declined by more than 50 percent since Castro took power .	What has this administration ever done for the Polish people ? What has this administration done in building the strength and prestige of the United States ? He talks about not losing a single inch of free territory . Cuba ? Now Laos . Possibly Guinea .

1315	unemployment	no_relation	Last night , in our debate , Mr. Nixon was asked to give his program for economic growth - what he intended to do to put idle plants and idle men back to work - to move America toward new heights of production and strength - to provide new jobs for an expanding population . But Mr. Nixon had no new program , no new approach ; just the same old tired policies which have resulted in a doubling of unemployment and in a slowing down of our growth until , today , we are growing more slowly than every other industrial nation in the world - policies which have resulted in a steel industry operating at only 50 percent of capacity - an automobile industry which has laid off thousands of men - and a State of Michigan where more than 200,000 men are unemployed and which has never emerged from the Republican recession of 1958 . But the Democratic Party does have a program - a program which will reverse the downward trend of the past 8 years - which will put men back to work and move America toward new heights of productivity and abundance - which will build the stronger America on which the cause of freedom depends .	The figure prior to this was 8 percent , which had 8 percent over a period of a year or 18 months . I believe that that program could be useful in using defense contracts most of which are not by bid but which are negotiated , to put those in areas where it is possible , where there is chronic unemployment and little hope for new industry . I would feel both of those , plus the coal research bill , plus the national fuels policy , I believe all of those would be of assistance in eastern Kentucky and these other hard-hit areas .

1316	disarmament	support	We talked tough when communism began to grow in Cuba - but Cuba is a Communist satellite today . We have talked tough about the need for disarmament - but the arms race is more intense than ever . We have a magnificent record of talking tough - but we do not have a magnificent record of halting the advance of communism and strengthening the spread of freedom .	Mr. Nixon may now say he has been urging an acceleration of our defense all along - but in his August 10 press conference the President said he knew of no such different viewpoint by the Vice President , adding :  Certainly if there is , he has n't come to me about it .  What was the Security Council doing while the Nation was undergoing this experience ? Why would anyone point with pride to presiding over successive blows to our security and prestige - Indochina , Hungary , Suez , Sputnik , the riots in Venezuela , the collapse of the summit , the riots in Japan , the collapse of the Baghdad Pact , the failure of disarmament , the U-2 fiasco , and now Cuba and the Congo ? Why would anyone boast about presiding over the Security Council during the years it rejected the now accepted findings of the Gaither report , the Killian report , and the Rockefeller report - during the years it held back our missiles and frustrated our efforts in Space - during the years it failed to come up with one new idea of any importance : for  Atoms for Peace  was a slogan , the Eisenhower Middle East Doctrine was a farce , the  open skies  plan was a gesture , and the Baghdad Pact was a failure . Mr. Nixon has presided , in short , over the decline of our national security .	Kennedy_September_17_1960	Kennedy_August_24_1960

He suggested Government intervention in effect , in the affairs of Cuba . There was so much consternation that the next day he took it back and said , I did n't mean it .	If he pursued the programs he has advocated domestically - programs which could only produce cruel inflation and Government interference with every aspect of our economic life , he could only pipe us to recession or worse . If he pursued the policies abroad which he has suggested , apology to Khrushchev , retreat in the Pacific , open interference in Cuba , he could only pipe us into grave international crisis or worse . Take a specific field : Senator Kennedy 's campaign to talk us into a recession has now reached phase 2. If elected , he says , he will counsel with President Eisenhower about how to deal with it .

Mr. Nixon leads a party which regards $ 1.25 minimum wage as extreme , which regards medical care for the aged tied to social security as extreme . Mr. Nixon leads a party which Alf Landon once led , from Pennsylvania .	The overall increase in the cost of living has been only about 22 percent . For medical care it has been 35 percent , for rent 30 percent , for the general costs , particularly in the heavy industries , it has gone up more than 30 percent . This is a serious problem , not only to our own people who are adversely affected by a steady increase in their cost of living , but it is also a serious problem in our attempts to compete in other markets , in automobiles , in steel , in heavy construction .

Since that time unemployment has risen to more than 6 percent , the highest since the great recession of 1958 . In the past 5 months we have lost almost $ 1 billion of our dwindling gold reserves to foreign banks .	[ Applause . ] Franklin D.

It 's just being around to enjoy it , because we can have the best jobs and medical care and housing and all that sort of thing that we can imagine , and if we are n't around , we 're not going to know it , so , the most important qualification of the next President of the United States must be this : Is he the man best qualified , by experience , by judgment , by background , to keep the peace , keep it without surrender of principle or territory ? This is the great test , and I ask you to apply it . Now , looking at this issue , let me tell you that if we 're going to keep the peace , we must understand the men who threaten it .	And what about that future ? We want a future of progress , but above all , the people of this country are concerned that our children may grow up in a world in which we can be free and we can live at peace - and that is the most important thing that Americans must think about at this time . Now , obviously , I know people could say ,  Well , now , just a minute , Mr. Nixon , do you mean that peace and developing policies that will keep peace and freedom are more important that jobs , more important than good medical care and more important than housing and education and the like ?  And the answer is that of course all those things are important too . But we can have all those things and it wo n't do us any good if we 're not around to enjoy them .

A shift of four or five votes in the House last June would have enacted a real minimum wage bill , with coverage for several million more families and a minimum of $ 1.25 an hour .

Here in Michigan you have led the Nation in your educational programs .	It is a view sharply in contrast with the charity approach , or the demeaning consignment of the aged as dependent burdens upon their families and public relief .

When he was there in 1955 , he said , and you can judge his experience ,  I am convinced that communism has passed its highwater mark in Latin America ,  at a time when the Communists were about to communize Cuba . Our third failure has been our inability to establish contact with the young people of that area that will run the country .	And this would not have happened in Cuba if the Republican leadership Mr. Nixon represents every step which foresight and experience should have directed them to take - in order to prevent a Communist victory only 90 miles from our shores .

If you believe that the area redevelopment bill , which has been vetoed twice , which would mean so much to this community and other communities , which are hard hit by chronic unemployment , and you want it vetoed a third time , you should vote for Mr. Nixon .	He did not equivocate , because he was the President of the United States . The Lincoln tradition is not found in a man who considers $ 1.25 minimum wage to be , and I quote him  extreme .  The Lincoln tradition of courage [ applause ] is not found in a man who considers Federal aid for education and teachers salaries to be  extreme ,  and I quote him accurately , and who calls helping our older citizens through the medium of social security to provide medical care for their aged life - who considers that to be  extreme .

The peace requires that we have these adequate defenses - I know this Nation can afford them - and you know this Nation can not afford to be without them .

1336	medical care,health care	no_relation	If we appropriate $ 600 million for defense , the President can impound it . If we pass legislation dealing with the minimum wage or medical care for the aged tied to social security , if the President vetoes that bill , his veto can be sustained by one-third of the Senate plus one and / or one-third of the House plus one . Therefore , in order for the Congress , which is today Democratic , to fulfill its commitments as supporters of the Democratic platform it is also necessary to have a President that can work with the Congress and not against it .	The kind of a meeting that we had today indicates , I think , that partnership which can exist between the farmers of this country and the Federal Government . Senator John F. Kennedy tonight expressed keen disappointment on the defeat of the Anderson - Kennedy amendment to the medical care to the aged bill .  I am sure that the threat of a White House veto mentioned by every speaker opposing the amendment contributed to this defeat .	Kennedy_September_6_1960	Kennedy_August_23_1960

In short , freedom from fear was freedom from war - the pursuit of that freedom was the pursuit of peace - the method of achieving that freedom was the method of disarmament . Today , 20 years later , we are still far from Franklin Roosevelt 's goal .	In 1952 , during the campaign between Adlai Stevenson and Dwight Eisenhower , there was no discussion , really , of outer space , and yet this administration , when a similar opportunity was granted to it to make a significant breakthrough , to recognize the implications of the opportunity in the same way that Franklin Roosevelt had recognized it in 1941 , when this administration was informed of the significance of outer space , both militarily and scientifically , we did not respond . My judgment is that we did not respond there as we have not responded to our needs in Latin America , our needs in Africa , our needs in Asia , our needs in disarmament , our needs in arms , because this administration has not been able to attract people of intellectual vitality , curiosity , foresight , and vigor .

Franklin Roosevelt could put forward a minimum wage of 25 cents an hour in 1935 , but that does not mean the job was finished . Ninety percent of the Republicans could vote against 25 cents an hour in 1935 just as they voted against $ 1.25 minimium wage in 1960 .	Kennedy_October_23_1960	Kennedy_October_19_1960

As the guardian of our constitutional rights , the Federal judiciary must have at all levels the best possible judges .	I refer , of course , to the Social Security Act of 1935 . It is particularly appropriate that we mark that anniversary by the extension of the system to include medical care insurance for our older citizens . A quarter of a century ago , the people of the United States turned their back on the dole and the means test , and chose instead to rely on self-financed insurance , paid through the social security system , to protect themselves against the hazards of old age .

Why was the candidate for the Presidency of Brazil in the recent election - why did he feel compelled in the middle of his election to pay a journey to Havana and call on Mr. Castro ?

Ghana and Guinea in Africa , newly independent 2 years ago , both vote with the Soviet Union in the United Nations . It is n't going to be just Guinea and Ghana and Cuba , but we are going to meet that problem in every country in the world in the future .

Over and over again , we find him saying one thing one day and another thing another day , as soon as he reads the polls or hears the people .	In every one of these three instances , do you see what would have happened if he had been President ? In Quemoy and Matsu , it might have meant war or it might have meant surrender . In Cuba , it might have meant war , by inviting the Communists in - civil war , which we could n't stay out of . And in Paris - the U-2 flights - it would have meant certainly surrender of principle , and it would have encouraged Mr. Khrushchev to beat him to a pulp , because that 's the only thing he understands .

That is why , my friends , that is why the President of the United States has been correct in being firm in dealing with Mr. Khrushchev and not belligerent .

And I can only say I have seen these proposals over the years , and the United States could not have been more tolerant .	It is n't as spectacular as President Eisenhower has done to go before the U.N. and to lay it on the line for controlled disarmament - not phony disarmament - not where you simply have empty pledges , but a case where both sides will disarm . Because remember this : If we ever have disarmament where we disarm and the other side does n't , that means that we increase the risk of war rather than reduce it , and we 're not going to do that and we can be sure of that .

And today , unlike 1940 , the forces of alien tyranny have already found their way into the Western Hemisphere - to within 90 miles of your coast - to the island of Cuba . And this change has come about in the past 8 years .	This would n't have happened under Franklin Roosevelt , who warned the Nazis in 1940 to stay out of our hemisphere ; this would n't have happened under Harry Truman who warned the Communists in 1947 to stay out of Greece and Turkey . And this would not have happened in Cuba if the Republican leadership Mr. Nixon represents every step which foresight and experience should have directed them to take - in order to prevent a Communist victory only 90 miles from our shores . I do not know how Mr. Nixon can talk of firmness in view of his party 's record in Cuba .	Kennedy_October_18_1960	Kennedy_October_15_1960

I do n't believe this country can afford another recession .

If you believe that the area redevelopment bill , which has been vetoed twice , which would mean so much to this community and other communities , which are hard hit by chronic unemployment , and you want it vetoed a third time , you should vote for Mr. Nixon .

They are the efforts which Democratic Presidents and Democratic Congresses have made to write into law a whole platform of social legislation , which permits all Americans to participate in our standard of living , minimum wage , social security , unemployment compensation , housing , aid to education , medical care for the aged , all of the great litany of pieces of social legislation for which we are distinguished which make it easy for a Democratic candidate to run for the Presidency , and which Mr. Nixon 's party has opposed . It is our function , however , not to merely invoke the names of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman , not to merely live off what they did , but to bring these old programs up to date .	I believe the issue is very clear , and the people of this State should understand them . They are between a party which regards $ 1.25 minimum wage as too extreme , a party and a candidate which regards medical care for the aged tied to social security as too extreme , between a party which vetoes an area redevelopment bill as too extreme , between a party which regards a progressive farm policy which will bring supply and demand into balance as too extreme .

I believe it has presented to this country programs which move the economy of this country .	And they certainly should pay $ 1.15 .

Four-fifths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives , including the Congressman of this district , who is chairman of the congressional committee for all Republicans , voted against the $ 1.25 minimum wage for a 40-hour week , not for a business which is only ten , fifteen , or twenty-five thousand dollars a year , but for a business which makes more than $ 1 million a year , we wanted to pay them $ 1.25 by 1962 , not this year , but 1962 , and to pay those that were not covered by 1964 $ 1.25 , and four-fifths of the Republicans voted against it .	The bill has two major purposes . First , it will raise the minimum wage now received by 2 1/2 million workers from $ 1.10 to $ 1.25 an hour . Second , it will extend the protection of the Fair Labor Standards Act to 5 million additional employees , chiefly in large-scale interstate retail and service industries , thereby guaranteeing these employees a fair minimum wage and a just premium for overtime .

And , now , if I may turn to one final point , and I mention this particularly to this group here , because there are some students here : Necessarily , in a campaign we have to discuss what we term the so-called hard issues in terms of foreign policy , specific issues like Cuba , Quemoy and Matsu , Lebanon , et cetera , and there is a tendency for Americans to forget the really important asset that we have in this great struggle in which we 're engaged . You know what it is ? It is n't our great military strength , and it is n't our great economic strength , and these are both tremendously significant and necessary ; but the strength of America is in what we believe .	When I said that I had no idea that you would make even a greater blunder about Cuba . Consequently , I will talk about not only Quemoy and Matsu but also about Cuba every day during the next 2 weeks - I will do this because I am deeply concerned about the policies you advocate in those two areas of the world which might well lead to abandoning free territory in the Far East , and a loss of all of our Latin American allies in this hemisphere or worse .

1359	medical care,health care	no_relation	Why is this important ? Because the moment you have a compulsory health insurance program that is the first step toward socializing the medical profession in this country . And , my friends , whatever we may think about the costs of medical care - and they 're high , and they come particularly hard for families - not only older families , but younger ones as well - who have catastrophic illnesses , remember this : we 've got the best medical care in the world , and the reason it is is that our medical profession is free , that they are n't working for the Federal Government and I do n't want to reduce the standard of medical care . That 's why I say let 's continue to have a program that is voluntary .	We 're going to have to have more in the field of education . We 're going to have to have a better program in the field of medical care , but my friends , the reason why my programs are better for America than those of my opponent is this . That his would turn all of these problems over to the Federal Government , they would cost an amount equal - get this - each year to almost the entire gold reserve of America that 's in Fort Knox , and do you know what that means to you ? It means higher prices , higher taxes for the American people .	Nixon_October_29_1960	Nixon_October_28_1960
1360	unemployment	no_relation	 But Mr. Nixon and the party he leads say they are content , just as they have always been content , in the face of poverty and unemployment and an America with its most urgent needs unmet . The Republican Party which Mr. Nixon leads today is the same Republican Party which for half a century has opposed every single progressive measure which the Democrats have designed to improve human welfare and reduce human misery - the party which fought against the New Deal and tried to block the Fair Deal - the party which , in the past 8 years , has vetoed aid to areas of unemployment , blocked efforts to improve unemployment compensation , opposed raising the minimum wage , refused to expand the distribution of surplus food to the hungry , and failed to offer one single program to increase the welfare of the American people . But Americans will not forget Mr. Nixon 's party this November - and they will return the Democrats to leadership so that all Americans can share in American abundance .	Our problems are serious - and they have been with us for a long time . Our hard-hit textile and fish industries - the pockets of chronic unemployment and poverty - the problems of failing transportation - of unfair competition - of economic  old age .

This is an important election .	We have a minimum wage , but to be of any help at today 's prices it must be raised to $ 1.25 an hour .

1375	cuba	no_relation	I think my opponent was wrong . And more recently , in Cuba where he says that our policy of quarantining Mr. Castro is too little and too late , and where he advocated a policy which universally was interpreted as Government intervention in the affairs of that country , a policy which would have lost us every friend in Latin America , because it would have broken treaties with all of those countries , and a policy which , if carried out , would have invited war in this hemisphere , because certainly , if our Government had intervened , the Communists would have had a good excuse for coming in. Now , on all three of these points I recognize that Mr. Kennedy has said he has changed his mind , that he now supports the President on Quemoy and Matsu , that as far as Cuba is concerned , he did n't intend it to mean the way it sounded , and that in the field of the Paris Conference , that he agreed that the President , perhaps , conducted himself the right way under the circumstances ; but , my friends , that is n't enough . When you 're a candidate you can say something , make a mistake , and correct it the next day and nobody is the worse for it .	And then the Cuban situation . Do you recall that , where he advocated a policy which all the papers in the country , including those which endorsed him , said amounted to intervention in Cuba ? What would that have meant ?

I have confidence in an America able to afford the best schools and the best teachers in the world - an America where no one is denied his full constitutional rights by reason of his race or religion - an America where every family lives in a decent home in a decent neighborhood - an America where the cost of living is not completely beyond those who work for a living - particularly those receiving an inadequate minimum wage of $ 1 an hour . I have confidence that America is capable of operating at full capacity - that we could consume in new schools and hospitals and dams and highways the full output of our steel mills now operating at only half their capacity .	A shift of four or five votes in the House last June would have enacted a real minimum wage bill , with coverage for several million more families and a minimum of $ 1.25 an hour .

I think we can do better .	We are going to have to find in the 1960 's 25,000 new jobs a week for the next 10 years if we are going to maintain full employment in the United States . And even when we have done that , there are still those eddies , still those islands of unemployment , because of technological changes , because of many conditions .

First , it has been suggested that your objective is to pose as a champion of peace and disarmament . You are said to be bringing new disarmament proposals with you .	But I can not believe that there is one person in this State or Nation who would not like to see the arms race ended - the threat of war recede - and the billions now spent on weapons of destruction turned to schools and hospitals and homes and dams .

Can anyone imagine this Nation without social security , without unemployment compensation and old-age assistance , without minimum wages and maximum working hours , without Federal guarantees of collective bargaining , without regulation of security issues and stock exchanges , without the guarantee of bank deposits , without protection for our farmers ? There were many conferences on all these programs held here at Warm Springs . President Roosevelt used to talk about the  spirit of Warm Springs * * * the general feeling that we are all part of a family .	This revolution in nationhood has been but one of several other revolutions , all of which have been going on at the same time - and all of tremendous importance to history . There is the revolution in transportation and communication which is shrinking our world with every passing day ; there is the revolution in medicine which is enabling human beings to become healthier and live longer ; the revolution in automation , which increases our abundance , but also our unemployment ; the revolution of farm production , which could bring the eventual elimination of hunger in the world , but which so far has only brought disaster to the farm family ; the revolution of our exploding urban population which brings with it the problems of overerowded schools , urban blight , and crowded slums . There is the revolution in education , which sees more and more of our young people going to college , while two-thirds of the world 's population still remains illiterate ; the tremendously exciting revolution in space , which will soon carry man to other worlds undreamed of ; and the equally exciting and morally refreshing revolution for human rights for all citizens here at home .

I think the future is ging to be a difficult one for us , but I have the greatest confidence in this country .	Only one Republican voted for that bill , as only one Republican had voted in 1935 for the original Social Security Act . A national news magazine reported that when the Senate roll-call came killing medical care and when it was announced , the Vice President smiled , but the older people of this country who must take a pauper 's oath to receive medical care as aged citizens are not smiling , and I do not believe Mr. Nixon will smile on November 9.

Now , the last point that I make is one that I make particularly because I know of the great concern the people in these university communities have for the cause of disarmament . People have often spoken to me - my friends who are Quakers , as I am , have written to me - and they have said ,  Mr .	I see him , ruthless , tough , completely a man dedicated to one purpose only - the evil purpose of conquering the world , and this is what I know . If America ever makes the mistake of entering into a disarmament agreement , which he does not also keep with inspection , it will increase the danger of war rather than reduce it , and I 'll tell you why : We can not leave to a man who is the enemy of peace power to start a war and destroy the world . We have to have the power because we are friends of peace .	Nixon_October_27_1960	Nixon_October_22_1960
1409	disarmament	no_relation	We will never be belligerent .

But Mr. Nixon did n't say a word that was ever publicly recorded . Even more incredible , he did n't say a word when the Communists took power in Cuba - not 4 miles off their shores , but only 90 miles off our shores . Mr. Nixon saw what was happening in Cuba .

1411	disarmament	support	We have not only taken one step ; we have not only taken two steps , but we have gone the second mile , the third mile , way down the line on disarmament . The point is : the Soviet Union is blocking the road to disarmament , blocking the road to stopping tests . Why ? Because they want a closed society and they want no inspection .	We know what peace demands . We will always go the extra mile to strengthen peace , the extra mile to work for disarmament , the extra mile to reduce tensions , but we will always remember that the man we are dealing with and his colleagues are ruthless , fanatical aggressors and that they do not follow the rules of the game that we would like them to follow , and that we must treat them the way they are , and this means that we must never make a concession without being sure that we 're getting one in return , that we must never agree , for example , to disarmament unless we can be sure that they , too , are disarming . Why is this necessary for peace ? Because , as I said at my last stop , we 've got to remember that as long as the United States maintains its present position of being stronger than anyone who threatens the peace of the world we can be the guardians of peace ; but the moment that somebody or some nation that does not want peace - in other words , that would use war as an instrument of conquest - is stronger than we are , or thinks they are , then peace is no longer safe .

What I am concerned about is in 1970 I do n't want to see independent country after independent country begin to move where Guinea and Ghana have gone , where the Congo almost went and may still go , where Cuba has already gone , because for a simple reason they feel that the Communists represent the future , they feel that we are identified with the past , they feel that we are identified with colonialism , they feel that we are identified with the kind of future which they do not want .	For America can not afford to continue to waste her resources and the skills of her people . The implacable Communist drive toward world domination now reaches to within 90 miles of our shores - on the once - friendly island of Cuba - and communism is on the march in Asia , and Africa and the Near East .

1413	minimum wage	no_relation	Mr. Nixon made a speech 3 weeks ago about what we need to do in housing , and he said in that speech the Housing Act of 1949 works very well , that is the basic housing act . Do you know he voted against it as a Congressman ? He leads a party that voted 90 percent against a 25-cent minimum wage in the midthirties and votes 90 percent against $ 1.25 in 1960 . He leads a party that voted 90 percent against social security in the midthirties and voted 90 percent against the medical care for the aged tied to social security .	Let me say , briefly , I believe there are two points . First , those of you who are active in labor , those of you who lead organized labor movements , are concerned about the welfare of your people and concerned about the welfare of the general public , and you know very well , perhaps better than anyone , that this country still has unfinished business , that we have to maintain full employment , that we have to advance the standards of living of our people , of better housing , of better minimum wage , of medical care for the aged . Franklin Roosevelt could put forward a minimum wage of 25 cents an hour in 1935 , but that does not mean the job was finished .	Kennedy_October_28_1960	Kennedy_October_19_1960
1414	medical care,health care	no_relation	They do n't care , and I 'll prove it . We have a bill which does it the American way , not one that would have compulsory health insurance that would reduce the standard of medical care , that would compel millions of people who do n't want it and did n't need it to have it , but , one , a bill in which every American over 65 who wanted health insurance can get it , either private or Government , but in which no one in this country is compelled to have it against his will . That 's the American way of handling this problem .	We 're going to have to have more in the field of education . We 're going to have to have a better program in the field of medical care , but my friends , the reason why my programs are better for America than those of my opponent is this . That his would turn all of these problems over to the Federal Government , they would cost an amount equal - get this - each year to almost the entire gold reserve of America that 's in Fort Knox , and do you know what that means to you ? It means higher prices , higher taxes for the American people .	Nixon_October_29_1960	Nixon_October_28_1960
1416	minimum wage	support	For Mr. Nixon to say we ca n't afford to do more to clear our slums is downgrading America . The Republicans tell us our economy was never stronger ; then they tell us that a minimum wage of $ 1.25 an hour would break its back . Who can raise a family on $ 1.25 an hour , $ 50 a week ? For Mr. Nixon to say $ 1.25 an hour is  extreme ,  as he did , is underrating the great potential strength of the American economy .	Mr. Nixon leads a party which in 1935 voted 99 percent against the 25-cent minimum wage . And Mr. Nixon last week said $ 1.25 minimum wage is inflationary . I would like to see any American get along who lives in political life , from the President , Vice President , to the two candidates , on $ 1.25 an hour .	Kennedy_October_28_1960	Kennedy_October_9_1960
1417	medical care,health care	support	Now , what does this mean ? This means that we do want progress in this country , and want it to increase , but , my friends , the way to get it is to recognize that the engine of progress in the United States is not the Federal Government , but 180 million free individual Americans inspired by Government . Our opponents say they want progress and they 'll produce it , but you know how they say they 're going to get it ? They 're going to set up a huge new Government program in everything , whether its medical care or schools or housing or anything else , turn it over to the Federal Government , and they say this proves they care more for progress , that they will produce more . But , my friends , the record shows they 're wrong , because those are the same policies we found under Mr. Truman .	It shows you how we approach these problems , retaining individual enterprise , building on it , rather than supplementing it completely by Federal Government activities . Now , if I might turn to another subject , the last one , the most important of all , what could be more important than medical care , I am sure some of you may ask , or jobs , schools , the 4-day week in schools ? What could be more important that all these things ? Well , you know . The ability to be able to be around to enjoy them - and I say , as I said last night and as I will say throughout this campaign , that the most important issue in this campaign is this : Which of the two candidates for the Presidency is best qualified , by experience , by judgment , by background , to keep the peace , but keep the peace without surrender of principle or territory for the United States and the world ? This is the great issue .	Nixon_October_15_1960	Nixon_October_14_1960

But today the unemployment rate for the entire Nation is nearly 6 percent . The whole United States is rapidly becoming an area of substantial labor surplus .	For in the past 8 years the Republican Party has not proposed one single constructive new program to increase the welfare of the American people - not one new move of benefit to all the people , or those who need it most - and they have hampered , opposed , and obstructed every Democratic effort to deal with our urgent needs . Although there are 4 million unemployed workers in this country - forced to get by on an average unemployment compensation check of $ 31 a week - the Republican Party has blocked all Democratic efforts to modernize and extend our system of unemployment compensation . Although 5 million Americans must struggle for survival on Government surplus foods consisting of less than $ 10 a month worth of rice , flour , cornmeal and dried eggs for a family of four - the Republicans have refused to put into operation an expanded food distribution program voted by a Democratic Congress .

1420	minimum wage	no_relation	In the case of both of those bills , in the House Rules Committee , not one of the Republican members would vote to bring either one of those bills to the floor of the House . My understanding is that the only way that they reach an agreement to permit the minimum wage was because they had an understanding with the House conferees that they would not go beyond the House bill . So I think we did not do as well as I had hoped we could do .	The inequity between employees in the same establishment will be abolished . The justification for applying the proposed new minimum wage to the newly covered employees is the same as the reasoning which supports the increase in the minimum .

1421	unemployment	no_relation	A real  truth squad ,  for example , would find it necessary to ask Mr. Nixon such questions as these : 1. Why do you repeat the statement that real wages have gone up 15 percent during the present administration compared with only 2 percent in the previous one , when your own Department of Labor figures clearly establish that the increase between September 1945 ( the first postwar month ) and January 1953 was 18.3 percent while the increase between January 1953 and August 1960 has been 13.7 percent . 2. Why have you not personally admitted that you misquoted me when you said that in my Detroit speech on Labor Day I had said  What the American labor movement wants for America is what I want for America  when this statement did not appear in either my advance statement or in the speech as actually delivered ? 3. When you insist that Federal aid to teachers salaries means Federal control over education , are you aware of the fact that the present program for aid to federally impacted areas has been free of such control , and that the provision which you killed with your tie-breaking vote contained explicit language ruling out any Federal  direction , supervision , or control over the policy determinations , personnel , program of instruction , or the administration or operation of any school or school system  ? 4. How can you claim credit for the present administration for more new water project starts than any other time in our history , when the stated Republican position except in campaign election years has been a no-new-starts policy that the Democratic Congress has sought to overcome ? 5. How can you call the vetoed 1960 Democratic bill on depressed areas  straight pork barrel  when your own Secretary of Labor , just 24 hours before the veto was announced , called the bill  good enough so that any Senator or Congressman from a State with areas of chronic unemployment would have no alternative but vote for it  ? 6. Why do you take credit for the present levels of operations at the National Institutes of Health , when the Democratic Congress , ignoring threats of veto , raised the administration request from $ 400 million to $ 560 million for the present year - the sixth consecutive year that Democrats have raised administration requests ? 7. On October 5 , in Philadelphia , you talked about civil rights and said ,  My position and that of my running mate has been clear and straightforward . We have said the same thing in every section of the country .	I do not agree - and the Democratic Party has never agreed . Unemployment is not inisignificant to the almost 4 million Americans who want to work , but who ca n't find work - almost a quarter of a million of them in Michigan alone - or to the almost 900,000 Americans who have been out of work for more than 15 weeks and who are now classified as  long-term unemployed .  Unemployment is not insignificant to the families of the unemployed - families who are forced to live in substandard homes and are unable to maintain even a subsistence of living in the richest country on earth .

I select it because I know that the people of this State as the people of the other 49 States of the Union , want leadership which will continue to do what President Eisenhower has done , and for which the American people will be forever grateful to him , leadership that will keep the peace , keep it without surrender , leadership that will extend freedom , extend it without war , leadership which will make us proud of our Nation in the council of nations , leadership in which the President of the United States , when he goes to the United Nations , as a man of dignity , standing for disarmament , standing for progress , standing for helping the unfortunate people of the world , and gaining respect rather than making a fool out of himself as did Mr. Khrushchev when he was there at the United Nations - and I know that everybody in this audience , everybody listening to me on television and radio , recognizes that the problems are difficult , difficult not because of our choosing , difficult not because of the other peace-loving nations - and , fortunately , my friends , they are most of the nations in this world , our allies in Europe and in Asia , the so-called neutrals in Africa , and in South America , and in other countries . Certainly in this period we realize that the problems are difficult only because there is on the loose in the world a great aggressive force , a force which is fanatical which is ruthless , whose leaders do not follow the rules of international diplomacy , as we would like them to be followed , whose leaders - and I know them , and I speak from knowledge - are men who have one objective , and one only , and that is to conquer the world , conquer it without war , if they can , but willing to use any means , if that becomes necessary , and because when we have this kind of leadership , aggressive , always probing , always attempting to embarrass , always moving against us around the world , the period ahead is going to be a difficult one .

1429	medical care,health care	no_relation	This last session of the Congress for the last 4 weeks is a vivid example of what can happen when the country is divided in its leadership ; because the Republican Party opposed the $ 1.25 minimum wage , we did n't get it . Because the Republican Party - and only one Senator voted against them - opposed medical care for the aged tied to social security , which had the endorsement of Governor Rockefeller , as well as the Democratic Party , and it was beaten by five votes . And Time magazine this week said that the leader of the Republican Party smiled when he heard the results - this is the kind of thing which has happened in the month of August .	Yet that is just what we have been urged to do . When all the vague generalities are stripped away , nothing more is being offered by opponents of the Anderson amendment than an increase in the public assistance program to provide some increased medical care for the indigent . The committee bill does improve our public assistance to the most needy .	Kennedy_September_3_1960	Kennedy_August_23_1960
1430	medical care,health care	support	Here are the facts . I have fought for and will continue to fight for a voluntary Federal - State plan of medical care for the aged - a plan under which all persons 65 and over of moderate means could receive more help than they would receive under Mr. Kennedy 's plan . In addition , under his plan for a compulsory Federal health insurance program many of the wealthy would receive help and 3 million senior citizens with incomes of $ 2,000 or less would receive no help .	We are trying to encourage individual responsibility . Now let 's take medical care for the aged . I can speak from a personal standpoint about this .	Nixon_October_29_1960	Nixon_October_28_1960
1431	disarmament	no_relation	No home was safe and there was no freedom of religious worship . Mr. Khrushchev is in our country now , as he was a year ago , confident that all is going his way , smug in his recent successes , and piously talking about peace , colonialism , and disarmament . But how can you talk of peace , Mr. Khrushchev , when you and your Chinese Communist friends are undermining the peace every day , creating disorder and danger wherever you move ? How can you talk of colonialism when you are surrounded by your puppet dictators and when you hold in an iron grip a great empire stretching from East Berlin to Vietnam ? How can you talk of the achievements of your system , even if you beat us again by putting a man into outer space ? For we know that while you may bring a man back from outer space , you rarely bring one back alive from Siberia .	We can not do that by arguing with him - and we ca n't do that by smiling at him . The only way we can get his agreement to disarmament is by our strength of armaments , enough to stop the next war before it starts . That requires only one kind of defense policy - a policy summed up in one word - first .	Kennedy_September_20_1960	Kennedy_September_6_1960
1435	disarmament	no_relation	We are already racing from the jet age to the space age before meeting the safety , airport development , and other problems of the former . Space exploration that unravels the secrets of our universe , reconnaissance satellites that can replace a hundred U-2 planes watching over all the world , civilian travel in space vehicles , and the rule of law and disarmament in space itself , all these lie ahead of this generation . But we need not look only to the skies for new horizons .	He prepared a report . The report was thrown aside , and this time a New York lawyer without any experience in the field of disarmament became head of our mission . We had no position and we adopted that of the British .

1436	unemployment	no_relation	But our goals are not the same . I want a $ 1.25 an hour minimum wage , medical care for the aged through social security , Federal aid to help raise teachers salaries as well as schools , an adequate program of slum clearance and low-rent housing , and a program of aid to areas of chronic unemployment which would include northern Minnesota . These are my goals .	So part of it requires a local effort and part of it requires a State effort and part of it requires a national effort . I believe the next President of the United States should sign the following bills , and if I am elected I will do so : 1. The area distress bill , a bill which put the credit and power and vigor of the economy of the Federal Government in those areas where unemployment is higher than 7 or 8 percent for a long period of time . In other words , the Federal Government will loan its credit to businesses that wish to come to areas such as this , will provide vocational retraining for older workers , provide supplemental unemployment compensation benefits for those who are out of work for a long time , will aid in cleansing the rivers , will aid in trying to bring new industry into this area .

1437	unemployment	no_relation	 But Mr. Nixon and the party he leads say they are content , just as they have always been content , in the face of poverty and unemployment and an America with its most urgent needs unmet . The Republican Party which Mr. Nixon leads today is the same Republican Party which for half a century has opposed every single progressive measure which the Democrats have designed to improve human welfare and reduce human misery - the party which fought against the New Deal and tried to block the Fair Deal - the party which , in the past 8 years has voted aid to areas of unemployment , blocked efforts to improve unemployment compensation , opposed raising the minimum wage , refused to expand the distribution of surplus food to the hungry , and failed to offer one single program to increase the welfare of the American people . But Americans will not forget Mr. Nixon 's party this November - and they will return the Democrats to leadership so that all Americans can share in American abundance .	The raising of the minimum wage and its extension to cover millions of unprotected American workers must be one of the first items on the agenda of the next administration . Our unemployment benefits , too , must be standardized and extended . By assuring working Americans of a living wage , by assuring unemployed Americans that they will be able to have the basic necessities of life , we help not only New England against substandard competition ; we help the entire Nation .

1439	minimum wage	support	In the midthirties , 90 percent of the Republican Party voted against a 25-cent minimum wage . This summer , as your Congressman can tell you , in the House of Representatives , 90 percent of the Republicans voted against a minimum wage of $ 1.25 an hour , $ 50 a week for a 40-hour week , for a business that makes more than a million dollars a year , and Mr. Nixon called it extreme . He is frozen in the ice of his own indifference if I ever saw a Republican candidate who was .	I do n't think the monetary and fiscal policies which this administration has followed are good enough . I believe that when they stand against the minimum wage of $ 1.25 an hour , I think they are standing in the way of progress . We have high interest rates and as a partial result we built this year 200,000 less homes than we needed in this country to stay up with our population .

In 1955 Mr. Nixon went to Cuba to view conditions for himself . But his only reaction was to praise  the competence and stability  of the Batista dictatorship which was , even then , threatened by Communist activities - and to say that  communism has reached its high-water mark in Latin America  at a time when Communist influence was beginning to rise , and only a few short years before the Communists took over all of Cuba . Mr. Nixon saw nothing wrong in Cuba - he made no recommendations for action - he did not warn America that danger was growing - and as a result the Communists took over Cuba with virtually no opposition from the United States .

1441	cuba	no_relation	But in the past 8 years we have not demonstrated such concern . We have reacted to a crisis in Guatemala or a crisis in Panama or a crisis in Cuba , and then , when the crisis was over , we continued to ignore the long-range problems and needs which were at the root of all the trouble . The good neighbor policy is no longer enough .	[ Applause . ] I believe that the people of the United States would like to hear him discuss his views on an island not 4 miles off the coast of China , but 90 miles off the coast of the United States - Cuba .

1442	medical care,health care	no_relation	Only one Senator voted with us in the U.S. Senate , Senator Case of New Jersey , a Republican , so that record is very clear . Even though at the outset the medical care to the aged was endorsed not only by Democrats but by Governor Rockefeller . It is a fact that the Vice President voted against the establishment in Mr. Flemming 's own Department , HEW , in 1951 or 1952 .	Only that approach can provide the required protection in a satisfactory way . Can there really be any doubt that systematic prepayment under the insurance system is to be preferred to the increased drain on general revenues ? Can there be anything but doubt about the ability of the States to raise money - especially when about half of the States now fail to match all the Federal funds at their disposal ? Can we really , in this day and age , say in all honesty that 50 different States with 50 different abilities to finance medical care are to be preferred to an orderly , nationwide system ? Can we really say that we favor social insurance for retirement , survivors and disability benefits , so as to avoid putting the relief tag on our citizens , and then make an exception when they become ill ? Mr. President , the answers are clear . I urge the adoption of the Anderson amendment .	Kennedy_September_7_1960	Kennedy_August_23_1960
1443	cuba	no_relation	I think my opponent was wrong . And more recently , in Cuba where he says that our policy of quarantining Mr. Castro is too little and too late , and where he advocated a policy which universally was interpreted as Government intervention in the affairs of that country , a policy which would have lost us every friend in Latin America , because it would have broken treaties with all of those countries , and a policy which , if carried out , would have invited war in this hemisphere , because certainly , if our Government had intervened , the Communists would have had a good excuse for coming in. Now , on all three of these points I recognize that Mr. Kennedy has said he has changed his mind , that he now supports the President on Quemoy and Matsu , that as far as Cuba is concerned , he did n't intend it to mean the way it sounded , and that in the field of the Paris Conference , that he agreed that the President , perhaps , conducted himself the right way under the circumstances ; but , my friends , that is n't enough . When you 're a candidate you can say something , make a mistake , and correct it the next day and nobody is the worse for it .	My friends this is n't Just a moot question . What if he had been President and done this And then Cuba , where all the newspapers in this country and in this continent , interpreted his remarks on Cuba to indicate intervention by the Government in that country , which would have brought disastrous consequences , lose our friends in America , lose our friends throughout the world , and invited the very Communists to come into this country that we do not want - all these things . My friends , three times he 's had a chance .	Nixon_November_2_1960	Nixon_November_1_1960
1444	minimum wage	no_relation	If the people 's interest is going to be protected , the President of the United States must stand for that protection . It is the President of the United States that can set the goals for the country in housing , minimum wage , social security , unemployment compensation , and in equality of rights for all Americans , regardless of their race or color . I stand in direct succession to Truman and Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson , who advanced the right of all Americans to participate equally in our society .	I do n't mean that they have not come up with new legislation . The fact of the matter is that every piece of major legislation which is the hallmark of Franklin Roosevelt 's administration from social security to minimum wage , from the Securities and Exchange Act to TVA , every one of those pieces of legislation was opposed - at the time they were written - by the Republican Party . They say our goals are the same .	Kennedy_October_3_1960	Kennedy_September_27_1960
1445	disarmament	no_relation	Our aspiration is for peace , not merely a peace which lasts between wars , not merely a peace which hangs on the brink of war , not merely a peace of the death , but a peace enforced and controlled by the United Nations against the universal danger of common destruction . We want a peace in which the funds now poured into the destructive implements of war may be channeled into the constructive results of disarmament , in a great multinational effort to harness our rivers , eradicate disease , take care of our children , care for the aged . We want a peace in which we can truly beat our swords into plowshares , and our hydrogen bombs into atomic reactors .	They are afraid of diplomatic policies that teeter on the brink of war . They are dismayed that our negotiators have no solid plans for disarmament . And they are discouraged by a philosophy that puts its faith in swapping threats and insults with the Russians .

1446	cuba	no_relation	After doing nothing for 6 years while the conditions that give rise to communism grew - after ignoring the repeated warning of our Ambassadors that the Communists were about to take over Cuba - after standing helplessly by while the Russians established a new satellite only 90 miles from American shores - Mr. Nixon and the Republicans , after 2 years of inaction since Castro took power , now attempt to make up for this incredible history of blunder , inaction , retreat and failure , by cutting off several million dollars worth of exports in a move which will have virtually no effect by itself in removing Communist rule from Cuba . In cutting off a carefully limited number of the American goods which can be sent to Cuba Mr. Nixon has made a dramatic but almost empty gesture - a gesture which will have so little impact on Castro as to be almost meaningless . The State Department itself admits that our exports to Cuba have already declined by more than 50 percent since Castro took power .	I contrast that call to the dim , silent trumpet that this administration has given forth in the last few years . In Cuba , the Communists have established a satellite . In Venezuela , angry mobs assault the Vice President of the United States .	Kennedy_October_20_1960	Kennedy_October_18_1960
1447	disarmament	support	We must also be ready to reassume the initiative in the conduct of our foreign affairs - or act to spread freedom as well as to react against the spread of communism . We must propose new and workable programs for disarmament , for banning nuclear testing , for reducing tensions in the many trouble spots around the world from Berlin to the Formosa Straits . For only an America which is applying its full resources of imagination and thought and strength to the resolution of the world 's great problems - only such an America will be able to maintain its position as the champion of peace and the protector of freedom everywhere .	Disarmament today is just as complicated as armaments - involving complex problems of surveillance , reconnaissance , seismography , atmospheric sampling and testing stations . A successful blueprint for a safe disarmament is as difficult to devise as a successful blueprint for modern war . But the hard facts of the matter are that we have fewer than 100 people in the entire Federal Government working on these problems .	Kennedy_September_17_1960	Kennedy_September_9_1960
1448	minimum wage	no_relation	From now until November 8 we are taking our ease to the forum in which it belongs , where there is no threat of veto , where there is no parliamentary obstruction , and where we will be successful - and that is the forum of the American people . Until a Democrat is in the White house , the Republicans can block action on an adequate minimum wage , they can water down medical care for the aged , they can play politics with civil rights , they can block action on a decent housing bill and a good school bill . But they can not block the American people on November 8. The theme of this campaign is going to be action - action at home to keep pace with our growing needs , to help the unfortunate , to build a still greater nation - and action abroad , to match the rise in Communist power , to meet the turbulent revolutions reshaping our globe .	The nature of the employer 's business is irrelevant . Thus , there may be two employees , working side by side in the employ of the same employer , one of whom is protected by the statutory minimum wage and one who is not . For example , a wholesaler 's order clerk who typed orders for goods purchased out of State would be entitled to the statutory minimum , but the billing clerk at the next desk who typed bills for customers inside the State would lack the same protection .

As long as America is the strongest nation in the world , the world need not fear that there will be war , because we will use our strength to keep peace , and I think that all of you , including those who are as dedicated to peace as I am , will say that we want the next President of the United States always to go the extra mile , as President Eisenhower has , to negotiate with Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else for disarmament . We want to go the extra mile to strengthen the United Nations and the instruments of peace , but under no circumstances do we want the next President to be a man who will be fooled , who will make concessions to them without getting concessions in return , and , above all , we do not want the next President to be one who will reduce the strength of America unless we 're absolutely sure that the enemies of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time .	He has worked to see that this new country and all others can retain its independence and this all Americans are proud of . Yes ; he has worked for disarmament but not a phony disarmament because this Nation must never disarm until we get absolute assurance that those who threaten the peace of the world , as we do not , are also disarming at the same time . And all Americans support the President in that I 'm sure .	Nixon_October_22_1960	Nixon_October_17_1960
1454	cuba	no_relation	He was wrong and Dwight Eisenhower was right - and thank God Dwight Eisenhower was President [ cheers and applause ] because , you see , if regrets had been expressed Khrushchev would have ground us into a pulp and got his demands on Berlin . And the third point - and this is what I call shooting from the hip - the difficult problem in Cuba , this little pipsqueak , Castro , down there stirring it up ; and , so , everybody says ; Why do n't we get rid of him ? Why do n't we send the Marines in ? My friends , the reason we do n't is that we do n't want to make a second Hungary out of 5 million people on the island of Cuba . The reason we do n't is that we know the people of Cuba will take care of this or any other dictator in their good time if they get the moral support of the United States .	He now agrees with the President on the summit conference - he does n't believe he could have apologized . He now agrees with the President on Cuba - he did n't mean Federal intervention in Cuba .

1455	cuba	no_relation	[ Cheers and applause . ] And I can only add to what Cabot Lodge has said : It is very easy to do as our opponents have - to say the President was wrong on Quemoy and Matsu in not surrendering two islands of freedom ; he was wrong in not apologizing to Khrushchev ; he was wrong in what he did in Cuba , and then to take it back the next day . My friends , it is very easy to do that when you 're a candidate ; but , my friends , when the President sits in that oval room in the White House , and when he decides something , it 's for keeps .	The Soviet Union has 10 times as many broadcasts in Spanish to Latin America as we do . We have no program , for example , to Cuba in radio or TV to tell the people of Cuba that we still are their friends , that we want them to be free . These are the things that we have to do to try to build a strong country here , to try to build a progressive and forward-looking country that 's meeting its problems , to try to find some way to distribute our food .

We want a peace in which we can truly beat our swords into plowshares , our bombs into reactors , and our rockets into vehicles for exploring outer space .	Now , when they make a proposal like this , it 's a cynical attempt to prevent progress , that 's what it is it shows that they do n't really want disarmament . Q. Can you estimate how long your disarmament duties will keep you under this self-imposed noncampaigning status ? A. Well , it is n't really self-imposed . It is - would obviously be inappropriate for me to , as the U.S. representative to the United Nations - to engage in partisan politics .	Kennedy_September_9_1960	Nixon_August_1_1960
1458	minimum wage	attack	[ Applause . ] The second bill that was up and which is an issue in this campaign was a bill to provide $ 1.25 minimum wage . Four-fifths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives , including the Congressman of this district , who is chairman of the congressional committee for all Republicans , voted against the $ 1.25 minimum wage for a 40-hour week , not for a business which is only ten , fifteen , or twenty-five thousand dollars a year , but for a business which makes more than $ 1 million a year , we wanted to pay them $ 1.25 by 1962 , not this year , but 1962 , and to pay those that were not covered by 1964 $ 1.25 , and four-fifths of the Republicans voted against it .	You have the Kennedy bill , which would raise the minimum wage on a graduated basis to a dollar and a quarter in 3 years , and which would expand coverage to 5 million people not presently covered . You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase . It takes coverage away from some .	Kennedy_September_28_1960	Nixon_August_13_1960

And I certainly would reply by saying that other things also are very important : We want better schools in America ; we want better health care in America available to all of our citizens ; we want better jobs for our people ; we also want to see the income of our farm families participate in the tremendously increasing prosperity which Americans are enjoying . But , above all , my friends , we want to see these young people , these schoolchildren who by the thousands we have seen along the streets of these Iowa towns and cities today , and who are here by the thousands , we want to see that they grow up to enjoy all these other good things - that they do have a life of peace for themselves and for the world .	[ Laughter . ] These slogans , I think , indicate a whole state of mind , and that is the Republican policy which , in my opinion , has prevented the passage or has attempted to block the passage of every single piece of progressive legislation from Wilson 's Federal Reserve Board , to our attempt to provide medical care for the aged in the last session of the Congress . Can you tell me one piece of new legislation which benefits our people that has been passed in the last 8 years ? I ca n't name one .	Nixon_September_16_1960	Kennedy_September_16_1960

Cuba , Latin America , Asia , China , Russia - the world is full of hazards and peril and opportunity in the 1960 's , and those hazards can be overcome , those perils can be met , those opportunities seized only if we in the United States are building a strong society committed to progress which the Republican Party has never been . [ Applause .	And then third , the incident on Cuba ; again a point of issue in our debate . Here it was shooting from the hip , but missing the mark , the President taking the correct position of quarantining Mr. Castro , quarantining him by economic and political means , and Mr. Kennedy then saying this is n't enough , we 've got to go further and then making the outrageous suggestion that the Government of the United States should intervene directly - and that 's the way it was interpreted all over the world - into Cuba . This would have invited the Communists in , probably resulted in civil war or world war .	Kennedy_November_7_1960	Nixon_November_6_1960
1462	unemployment	attack	In 1939 , when war came in Europe , unemployment in America , after 6 futile years of their trying to solve it , stood just under 9 ½ million . Let 's face it : It took war to solve the unemployment riddle for them . After the war was over opposition spokesmen forecast some 6 million unemployed .	Unemployment is not insignificant to an America which desperately needs the skills and labor of all its citizens if it is to rebuild the strength which alone can maintain the cause of peace and freedom in a perilous and changing world . And unemployment is not insignificant to the Democratic Party - which has always pursued a policy of full employment - which has never said that there  must be some unemployment  and which is going to see that there are jobs for all Americans in the sixties . In fact , unemployment is only insignificant to Mr. Nixon and a Republican Party which has opposed every Democratic effort to put men back to work in the past 8 years - which has complacently stood by while unemployment rose from less than 2 million in 1952 to 4 million today and while Michigan lost more than 100,000 jobs despite an expanding population .

1465	disarmament	attack	Such an effort requires not only long-term development loans but education , student exchanges , stepped up Voice of America broadcasts , concerned and competent Ambassadors , and a wide range of measures designed to increase the strength of freedom and stimulate the economic advance on which freedom often depends . Fourth , we will strengthen our planning the preparation for disarmament . One of the most glaring failures of the past 8 years has been our failure to prepare properly for any arms control conference since the end of the Korean war .	In other words , disarmament without inspection increases the risk of war . It 's only disarmament with inspection that will reduce the risk of war . So , I pledge to you that , with my colleague , Cabot Lodge , to whom I am going to give special assignments in this field , we will take the initiative at every opportunity to deal with Mr. Khrushchev and to work out whatever arrangement we can that will provide inspection for disarmament , for tests , for all these other items which I am discussing tonight .	Kennedy_November_7_1960	Nixon_November_3_1960
1467	disarmament	attack	 Let me tell you about disarmament . When people say ,  I 'm for disarmament ,  and when some people write to me and say  Why , when Mr. Khrushchev comes over and says he 's for total disarmament - why do we have to insist on inspection ? Why ,  they say ,  could n't we just do it ? Would n't that be real leadership in the world ? Would n't that be bold and imaginative ?  Yes , it would ; but do you know what would happen ? The moment the United States ever enters into an agreement for disarmament , which would result in increasing his strength as against ours , we do n't help the cause of peace . We hurt it , because - why is America the guardian of peace today ? Because we 're the strongest nation in the world , and the difference is : We do n't want to use our strength for anything except to keep the peace .	 It is only when we have a military force strong enough to convince the Russians that they 'll never be able to gain any advantage through military strength , only when we can approach the conference table in a position of equality , only then can we hope for fruitful negotiation . Second , we must establish an arms control research institute , under the direction of the President , to undertake , coordinate , and follow through on the research , development , and policy planning needed for a workable disarmament program . Detection and monitoring systems will require new techniques of aerial reconnaissance and radar surveillance , new uses for our communications systems , computers , and cameras , new ways to denature plutonium and inspect power reactors , and a whole host of additional research projects .

[ Applause .	Now , people disagree with that . Senator Kennedy and Senator Johnson believe that the social security route , which would compel all people - whether they wanted health insurance or not - to , in effect , have it through subscribing to social security , is the best one to provide medical care or people over 65 . I believe that the most effective method is through a program which will provide a choice whereby people who want to have the protection for catastrophic illnesses or , for that matter , for noncatastrophic illnesses , if they so desire , can have it , but where they are not forced to have it if they do not desire , and where they can choose getting that protection through government or through private plans , which they might choose , with some government assistance .

By assuring working Americans of a living wage , by assuring unemployed Americans that they will be able to have the basic necessities of life , we help not only New England against substandard competition ; we help the entire Nation .	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .

This administration has opposed both area assistance bills .	Consider their credentials : In charge of the Government for almost 7 years before war broke out in Europe , their record shows that unemployment in the United States stood at just under 9.5 million in 1939 . They did not succeed in solving the unemployment problem until the coming of World War II . From 1946 to 1953 , while still in charge , they gave the Nation 7 years of inflation .

1471	minimum wage	attack	The Republican program in education , unlike Mr. Kennedy 's would provide funds for school construction which would enable State and local districts to use their money for raising teachers salaries , without involving the Government in the direct payment of teachers salaries which would lead toward dictation from Washington as to what is taught in our schools to our children . It is a matter of record that Republicans have extended social security and strengthened minimum wage legislation . Moreover , we care too much for people to advocate programs , as my opponent does , which would raise Federal spending by over $ 15 billion a year - programs so great they could be paid for , not out of miracles of economic growth , but by 180 million Americans in higher taxes and higher prices .	Social security ? The Republicans voted 90 percent against social security in the mid-thirties and voted 99 percent against medical care for the aged tied to social security in 1960 . The Republicans voted 90 percent against a 25-cent minimum wage in the mid-thirties and voted 90 percent against the $ 1.25 minimum wage in 1960 . If you think that party is committed to progress , then Mr. Nixon is your man .	Nixon_October_29_1960	Kennedy_October_29_1960
1472	unemployment	attack	If the people 's interest is going to be protected , the President of the United States must stand for that protection . It is the President of the United States that can set the goals for the country in housing , minimum wage , social security , unemployment compensation , and in equality of rights for all Americans , regardless of their race or color . I stand in direct succession to Truman and Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson , who advanced the right of all Americans to participate equally in our society .	I will tell you today the things that I believe are necessary , the program that I stand for . I will tell you , for example , that I think we need economic policies that will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million people , that will increase employment , that we need Government policies , for example , which will provide better guarantees and better protection against unemployment than we presently have . I will tell you today , for example , that I think those policies will produce more economic programs and progress than will the policies of our opponents .

1473	medical care,health care	no_relation	Franklin Roosevelt said ,  This generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny ,  and so does this one , so does this one 25 years later . It is not only medical care for the aged . It is minimum wage , it is housing for the elderly , public housing .	I 'm proud of that record , and we have a program that will produce greater progress and greater prosperity on those issues for America in the future , I can assure you . But may I say it would n't be enough to rest our case there because , you know , you can have the best jobs , the best social security , the best medical care that we can possibly imagine , and it is n't going to make any difference if we 're not around to enjoy it . And , so , I say peace without surrender , the extension of freedom , this is the great issue .	Kennedy_September_14_1960	Nixon_September_12_1960
1476	minimum wage	attack	[ Applause . ] I do n't believe that this city and the State of Ohio wants for a President of the United States in 1961 , a man who thinks a minimum wage of $ 1.25 an hour for someone working in interstate commerce is extreme . I do n't believe that anyone who believes in Federal aid to education , and to make sure that our teachers are well compensated - anyone who believes that that is extreme , I do n't believe the American people are going to endorse that leadership .	And , so I want to make clear where we do stand . I favor programs , programs that are constructive , programs that will work , programs that will produce progress ; more schools , a breakthrough in science , a breakthrough in medical care and medical research , progress in terms of better jobs for the American people , raising the minimum standards as far as our minimum wage , and our unemployment coverage is concerned . All of these things I stand for , but I want to make one thing clear : As far as the cost of my programs are concerned , they are billions less than what my opponent 's would cost .

1477	minimum wage	attack	The Republican program in education , unlike Mr. Kennedy 's would provide funds for school construction which would enable State and local districts to use their money for raising teachers salaries , without involving the Government in the direct payment of teachers salaries which would lead toward dictation from Washington as to what is taught in our schools to our children .

I would like to ask Mr. Nixon one single piece of new , progressive legislation , benefiting the people that the Republicans have put forward in the last 25 years . Ninety percent of the Republican Party in 1935 voted against the minimum wage of 25 cents an hour , and 80 percent of them voted against $ 1.25 in 1960 . The fact of the matter is that this State and the United States can not sit still in the 1960 's .	Nixon_October_29_1960	Kennedy_October_26_1960
1478	minimum wage	attack	They talked . But what did they produce ? They promised a 25-percent minimum wage increase in place of the program that President Eisenhower asked for and that could have been passed and should have been passed . What did the workers get ? Nothing at all .	Four-fifths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives , including the Congressman of this district , who is chairman of the congressional committee for all Republicans , voted against the $ 1.25 minimum wage for a 40-hour week , not for a business which is only ten , fifteen , or twenty-five thousand dollars a year , but for a business which makes more than $ 1 million a year , we wanted to pay them $ 1.25 by 1962 , not this year , but 1962 , and to pay those that were not covered by 1964 $ 1.25 , and four-fifths of the Republicans voted against it . I think these issues are important , not because the minimum wage is maybe the most important issue in the United States today , and not because medical care for the aged itself may be the most important issue , and not because aid to education itself may be the most important issue . I think the most important issue is the security of the United States and the peace of the world .	Nixon_September_29_1960	Kennedy_September_28_1960
1479	disarmament	attack	And I say that we can not and should not blame ourselves , our policies , our negotiators , their scientific advisers , or their instructions , for the unyielding refusal of the Soviets to make an agreement at Geneva . The time and patience which we have already expended to explore this way out of the disarmament dilemma have been full proof of our own intentions and those of the Soviets . The blame rests squarely on them .	In short , no problem is more vital or more urgent in the struggle for peace than the problem of effective arms control . Yet , in the past 80 years , this problem has been virtually ignored ; we have had no real disarmament policy . And we have completely failed to provide the effort and the leadership which the pursuit of disarmament demands .	Nixon_October_26_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
1480	disarmament	no_relation	 It is impossible for us to provide for the disarmament of outer space , the disarmament of nuclear weapons , unless we are in a position of parity with the Soviet Union . This administration has less than 100 people working in the entire Federal Government on the subject of disarmament . I think we can do a better job than that .	We will never negotiate with appeasement in mind . But we must be willing and we must search out the ways to find agreement where agreement is possible , on disarmament , on reducing tensions , throughout the world . And may I say in this case - and I am going to make an announcement at this time that I know will please you - that coming into Hawaii later in the campaign will be a man who is my running mate .

1481	minimum wage	attack	Meanwhile , the contradictory statements of Senator Kennedy still leave him opposed to this position . The misstatement : In the second debate Senator Kennedy said : The Republicans in recent years , not only in the last 25 years , but in the last 8 years , have opposed * * * minimum wage * * The facts : Senator Kennedy is saying that Republicans who opposed his particular bill are against minimum wage . The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve .	When a political party votes , in 1935 , 98 percent against the 25-cent minimum wage , I know what the party stands for ; and when that same political party in 1960 votes in the House of Representatives 85 percent against $ 1.25 minimum wage in 1960 , I know the Republican Party stands where it has always stood-against ; not for , but against . Mr. Nixon leads a party which regards $ 1.25 minimum wage as extreme , which regards medical care for the aged tied to social security as extreme . Mr. Nixon leads a party which Alf Landon once led , from Pennsylvania .	Nixon_October_19_1960	Kennedy_October_15_1960
1482	cuba	no_relation	For we have not only supported a dictatorship in Cuba - we have propped up dictators in Venezuela , Argentina , Colombia , Paraguay , and the Dominican Republic . We not only ignored poverty and distress in Cuba - we have failed in the past 8 years to relieve poverty and distress throughout the hemisphere . For despite the bleak poverty that grips nearly all of Latin America - with an average income of less than $ 285 a year - with an exploding population that threatens even this meager standard of living - yet our aid programs have continued to concentrate on wasteful military assistance until we made a sudden recognition of their needs for development capital practically at the point of Mr. Castro 's gun .	I think I should prefer to answer it in this way , the only responsible way . As President Eisenhower has indicated time and time again , the United States can not tolerate Russian influence or a Russian-dominated government in Cuba or in the Americas . Now the President has made that clear .	Kennedy_October_6_1960	Nixon_October_2_1960
1483	minimum wage	no_relation	We were not as successful as I hoped we would be . But I think the real difficulty is the fact that on the two bills which were most controversial , the $ 1.25 minimum wage , and the aid to the aged and social security , we were informed in both cases that if those bills passed , the President would veto them . All the President has to do to stop action is to veto any bill and he needs , according to the Constitution , only one-third plus one of either body to sustain his veto .	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage .

1484	unemployment	no_relation	That is why there are major pockets of unemployment in every center of heavy industry - in Buffalo , in Seattle , in Detroit , in Pittsburgh , in Youngstown . That is why unemployment is edging toward the 6 million mark . That is why the economy seems to be sliding into the third recession in 6 years .	The sorry lack of concern for the American people too often revealed by my opponent and his followers can be no better documented than by the record on distressed areas legislation . Five years in a row the President has recommended Federal help for those areas in our country affected with chronic unemployment . But my opponent and his party have preferred to make a political football out of a pressing human problem .	Kennedy_November_4_1960	Nixon_November_1_1960
1485	medical care,health care	attack	Let me speak now of a more important issue . I am sure when you heard the words  more important  some of you thought :  What could be more important than education for our children , a better job , adequate hospitals and health care , all these things that I have mentioned ?  The answer is :  We can have the best social security system , the best education , the best jobs that we can imagine , and it is not going to do any good unless we are around to enjoy them .  So I urge all of you , without regard to your partisan affiliations , to have this major issue in mind as you go to the polls on election day :  Which of the two candidates , which of the two tickets , do you believe best provides the kind of leadership that will keep the peace for America and keep it without a surrender of principle ?  Here we think we have a good record .	But the burden which should concern us most lies upon the American conscience . We can no longer tolerate growing patches of poverty and injustice in America - substandard wages , unemployment , city slums , inadequate medical care , inferior education and the sad plight of migratory workers . The enactment of this bill is only one step , but an essential step forward , as we cross this frontier to grasp the high opportunities which face the Nation .

1486	minimum wage	attack	I would answer the question , hoping that I am hitting the point , and if it does n't , if he will call back in , we will give this question priority . I have answered the question by saying that I favor the raising of the minimum wage to $ 1.15 . I also favor extending coverage to 3 million people not presently covered .	I just do n't believe that the 1960 's is a time to stand still . Every piece of important legislation of benefit to our people was opposed by the Republicans when they first came into being , away back to the Federal Reserve Board , all the reforms of the Roosevelt administration , social security , all the others , minimum wage , housing , benefits to the farmers , all opposed . Now , with that long history , TVA , the development of our resources , all in opposition , with that long history , how can we expect that that party and that candidate can move this country ahead , with all the changes coming on , the prospects for unemployment , the recession possibly this winter in 1961 , with our farm income down 25 percent , with 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls never seeing the inside of a college , who graduate from high school , our prestige in the world being affected , with Communists on the march , Castro on the march .

1487	cuba	no_relation	We have cooperated with and supported the United Nations . We have not bullied Cuba , in spite of the provocation of its Communist-oriented government . We have dealt with this threat to the peace and stability of the hemisphere as we pledged we would in our solemn treaty commitments .	That goes particularly today against the Soviet Union and the Chinese . We are going to have to wait and see what happens in Cuba . But any action that we do take , in my opinion , should be taken in concert with the Organization of American States .	Nixon_September_12_1960	Kennedy_September_7_1960
1488	cuba	attack	Equally important are the domestic issues which you and the Republican Party seem to wish to bury during this campaign - minimum wage , medical care for the aged , aid to education , and the rising rate of unemployment ; only a week ago you stated you were going to talk about Quemoy and Matsu every day for the final 3 weeks of the campaign . Now it is Cuba . These latter two are important issues but I think the American people want and deserve to hear us discuss all the important problems which face our country and to limit the subject of the fifth to one country would be to subvert the purpose of such a debate .	And on the other side there is the wrong and demagogic way - the right that I have pointed out , the wrong which Senator Kennedy has advocated - and I say this is a way of shooting from the hip on matters gravely affecting the security of the United States . And , so , finally , let 's look at the record , all three , the position on Quemoy and Matsu - slice off a bit of freedom ; maybe it will lead to peace ; the position on the summit conference - express regrets to Khrushchev ; maybe we can save the conference , and then this latest episode with regard to Cuba . I think when you look at these three episodes that this should convince many Americans that they could not rest well at night with a man with such a total lack of judgment as Commander in Chief of our Armed Forces in this critical period .

We have to have the power because we are friends of peace . As long as America is the strongest nation in the world , the world need not fear that there will be war , because we will use our strength to keep peace , and I think that all of you , including those who are as dedicated to peace as I am , will say that we want the next President of the United States always to go the extra mile , as President Eisenhower has , to negotiate with Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else for disarmament . We want to go the extra mile to strengthen the United Nations and the instruments of peace , but under no circumstances do we want the next President to be a man who will be fooled , who will make concessions to them without getting concessions in return , and , above all , we do not want the next President to be one who will reduce the strength of America unless we 're absolutely sure that the enemies of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time .

It is not chaos . It is not a military seizure of power like Cuba . Yet , Mr. Herter said 3 weeks ago that Ghana is supporting the foreign policy of the Soviet Union .	These are the times that you can read and have the time to read that you will never have later , and you can get the opportunity to specialize much later . You can learn about political science by participating in political organizations , and I would say certainly a political science course under the very able people who instruct you in our colleges and universities is worth while , but particularly to those who want to enter public service , if I could leave just one note - Remember , that while the broad background in the humanities and history and literature would seem to be very remote from the problems of Ghana and Cuba , from the problems of what we do about health care and what we do about the filibuster , remember those are the courses that will give you the judgment and the depth that is needed to react properly and intelligently to these great issues when they come before you years later , if you happen to enter public life . The last point that I would make is this : I want everybody here to certainly feel the necessity for , as I put it , going into politics ; I do n't mean all of you should run for office .

First , those of you who are active in labor , those of you who lead organized labor movements , are concerned about the welfare of your people and concerned about the welfare of the general public , and you know very well , perhaps better than anyone , that this country still has unfinished business , that we have to maintain full employment , that we have to advance the standards of living of our people , of better housing , of better minimum wage , of medical care for the aged . Franklin Roosevelt could put forward a minimum wage of 25 cents an hour in 1935 , but that does not mean the job was finished .	And , so I want to make clear where we do stand . I favor programs , programs that are constructive , programs that will work , programs that will produce progress ; more schools , a breakthrough in science , a breakthrough in medical care and medical research , progress in terms of better jobs for the American people , raising the minimum standards as far as our minimum wage , and our unemployment coverage is concerned . All of these things I stand for , but I want to make one thing clear : As far as the cost of my programs are concerned , they are billions less than what my opponent 's would cost .

And the answer is , Of course it is n't true . The answer is - and now I 'm going to give you my version - the answer is that America , is moving forward , that unemployment went down more than usual last month and employment went up to record heights .

Why ,  they say ,  could n't we just do it ? Would n't that be real leadership in the world ? Would n't that be bold and imaginative ?  Yes , it would ; but do you know what would happen ? The moment the United States ever enters into an agreement for disarmament , which would result in increasing his strength as against ours , we do n't help the cause of peace .	This is an issue which involves the lives of all of us , and I must say in this area as in so many others this Government has been under the control of those who have been uninterested , who have lacked intellectual curiosity , who have failed to realize that in these changing times we need the best talent we can get , constantly applied to all the new problems that disturb us .

This is a program for economic growth - a program which can start our economy moving again and put men back to work .

Unemployment dropped not only as to number but also as a percentage of the labor force .	The Republicans adopted the seemingly simple and easy policy of tightening interest rates when demand was strong and prices were rising - a principle that requires allowing rates to fall when the economy needed stimulation . But the facts of the matter are that each successive peak and each successive valley in the economy has ended with higher and higher interest rates - with the result that paradoxically high rates accompanied heavy unemployment , low production , and a slack economy . For this policy has not worked .	Nixon_October_19_1960	Kennedy_October_12_1960
1512	unemployment	no_relation	But both of them lived many , many years longer , and both of them , the longer they lived , gained love and affection from the American people - and I would only hope tonight that , however this election turns out , Senator Kennedy and I in the years ahead will be able to conduct ourselves with the dignity , the decency which earned the esteem and the love of the American people for the two men who were engaged in that great campaign of 1928 . The decline in unemployment throughout the country reported last week by the Departments of Labor and Commerce is good news for America . It must have come as a disappointing surprise to the opposition camp from which we are hearing so much foreboding talk about the future these days .	Unemployment is not inisignificant to the almost 4 million Americans who want to work , but who ca n't find work - almost a quarter of a million of them in Michigan alone - or to the almost 900,000 Americans who have been out of work for more than 15 weeks and who are now classified as  long-term unemployed .  Unemployment is not insignificant to the families of the unemployed - families who are forced to live in substandard homes and are unable to maintain even a subsistence of living in the richest country on earth . Unemployment is not insignificant to the children of the unemployed who are deprived of decent clothing and a decent diet .	Nixon_October_19_1960	Kennedy_October_14_1960
1513	disarmament	support	We hurt it , because - why is America the guardian of peace today ? Because we 're the strongest nation in the world , and the difference is : We do n't want to use our strength for anything except to keep the peace . We do n't want anything from anybody else , but remember this : The moment the men in the Kremlin ever have more strength than we have , the moment we ever enter into a disarmament agreement , which would not have ironclad inspection , in which they would gain strength against us , we find that the enemies of peace then , the men in the Kremlin , are in a position where they can do what they want , and that is : They would use their strength to start war . They would use it because their aim is to conquer the world .	It takes men and resources and firm leadership from the top . Above all , it takes a government which is organized for the pursuit of peace , as well as the possibility of war , a government which has a program for disarmament , as well as a program for arms . First , we must work to rebuild our rapidly deteriorating defenses .	Nixon_October_25_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960

It is a matter of record that Republicans have extended social security and strengthened minimum wage legislation . Moreover , we care too much for people to advocate programs , as my opponent does , which would raise Federal spending by over $ 15 billion a year - programs so great they could be paid for , not out of miracles of economic growth , but by 180 million Americans in higher taxes and higher prices .

When people say ,  I 'm for disarmament ,  and when some people write to me and say  Why , when Mr. Khrushchev comes over and says he 's for total disarmament - why do we have to insist on inspection ? Why ,  they say ,  could n't we just do it ? Would n't that be real leadership in the world ? Would n't that be bold and imaginative ?  Yes , it would ; but do you know what would happen ? The moment the United States ever enters into an agreement for disarmament , which would result in increasing his strength as against ours , we do n't help the cause of peace .	A recent independent survey concluded : The only continuous features of our efforts in the disarmament field have been a lack of continuity in top personnel and a paucity of planning and research efforts . As a result of this failure we have been steadily unprepared on disarmament . Our delegates to international conferences have been inexperienced , understaffed , and inadequately instructed .

My second concern is unemployment . Between November 1957 and August 1960 the rate of jobless workers , seasonally adjusted , has been below 5 percent of the labor force in only 3 months out of 34 .

I have stood for those things in 14 years in the Congress .	I think that unemployment compensation - our unemployment compensation principles and programs - should be revised , so that we can have a more effective method . That means longer periods which the unemployment compensation covers and also standards which are more general throughout the States , so that you can have a greater cushion during a recession than we presently have . These are the devices that I would use , one , to anticipate recession and , second , to fight it as you get into it and as you get out .	Kennedy_October_1_1960	Nixon_September_28_1960
1523	minimum wage	attack	To strengthen our country from within , he promises to move the Federal Government into the very heart of your school system by providing Federal dollars for use to pay the salaries of your teachers , which would inevitably bring Federal control of what is taught . To assure a vital economy , he promises a minimum wage that official studies show would force unemployment and business failures . To protect the unfortunate , he promises to give the wealthiest people in American a helping hand with medical costs in their later years , while withholding help from some 3 million people with incomes of $ 2,000 or less ; in fact , in the name of freedom he would force this medical program on one and all , save the 3 million who need help the most .	I think it is time that this Nation faced up to the agricultural revolution which has brought us so much abundance - that we forget about reshuffling the Benson program , as Mr. Nixon proposed , which will only bring us more farm surpluses and more farm foreclosures - and concentrate instead on a program of supply management which will give to each farmer his full parity of income . I have confidence in an America able to afford the best schools and the best teachers in the world - an America where no one is denied his full constitutional rights by reason of his race or religion - an America where every family lives in a decent home in a decent neighborhood - an America where the cost of living is not completely beyond those who work for a living - particularly those receiving an inadequate minimum wage of $ 1 an hour . I have confidence that America is capable of operating at full capacity - that we could consume in new schools and hospitals and dams and highways the full output of our steel mills now operating at only half their capacity .

1526	unemployment	no_relation	Once again the economy surged to levels that they so like to cite . So what judgment is to be made of the opposition 's 20-year stewardship of the Nation 's economic affairs ? 1. Its policy was a tragic failure in solving the problem of unemployment during the peacetime years from 1933 to 1939 . 2. During the following 6 years , preparation for war and war itself solved the unemployment problem for them .	Jobs outside of manufacturing have not taken up that slack . That is why unemployment has risen from 2 million in 1953 to 3 million to 4 million this summer , and at the current rate will exceed 4.5 million this winter . I pledge that a new administration will move at once to put our people back to work .	Nixon_October_19_1960	Kennedy_October_15_1960

No President - Democratic or Republican - will be satisfied with growing unemployment , lagging economic growth or excessive price inflation that adversely affects our trade with other nations as well as our stability here at home . And both candidates are also equally opposed to excessive , unjustified or unnecessary government intervention in the economy - to needlessly unbalanced budgets and centralized government .	Have you ever talked to a Negro mother as I have ? Have you ever heard her tell you , try to explain to a child in the South ? How do you explain that she can go into a store and buy a loaf of bread but ca n't sit at the counter and have a Coca - Cola ? This makes you understand that it is n't enough just to pass laws ; it is n't enough just to make speeches , but what you have to do is do what the Attorney General of the United States must do , not just a lot of promises and talk , but get in the leaders of chainstores and get them to agree to break down this barrier so that we can remove this block from the people of this country and our Nation . What about unemployment ? How can you believe me when I say I will move this economy forward , that we will use all the power of this Government to fight unemployment , to fight recession ; but , more than that , we 're going to use it in a positive way to stimulate employment , to open new avenues for expansion of economy ? How do you know ? How can you believe me ? I 'll tell you why . Because I know what it means .	Kennedy_October_12_1960	Nixon_October_5_1960
1528	minimum wage	attack	This summer , when we tried to improve the standards of social security by providing medical care for the aged tied to social security , again the great majority of the Republicans , over 90 percent , voted against medical care for the aged tied to social security . Eighty percent of the members of the House of Representatives who are Republicans voted against the $ 1.25 minimum wage , $ 50 a week for a 40-hour week for an industry , a business , that makes more than a million dollars a year .

1529	disarmament	attack	Whenever that balance changes , whenever the Soviet Union gains strength as against our strength , war 's danger increases , because they are wanting to use their strength not as we are , for peace , but to conquer the world . So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war . That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests .	And , of course , we must also seek disarmament because the only alternative to pursuit of an effective disarmament agreement is the pursuit of our present course - the arms race , the gap , new weapons , the development of even higher orders of mutual terror resulting in the ever higher likelihood of mutual destruction . But we will not move toward disarmament and a secure peace , we will not be any closer to freedom from fear , if we simply follow Mr. Nixon 's plan for meetings , more conferences , more study groups and discussions . For peace takes more than words .	Nixon_October_27_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
1530	disarmament	support	The struggle for disarmament will not be an easy one . For disarmament is an ideal just as peace itself is an ideal , but it was a great son of Wisconsin , Carl Schurz , who said : Ideals are like stars ; you will not succeed in touching them with your hands . But , like the seafaring man on the desert of waters , you choose them as your guides , and following them you will reach your destiny .	I select it because I believe it is the most important issue not only of this campaign , but of our time , of our generation , of this country . I select it because I know that the people of this State as the people of the other 49 States of the Union , want leadership which will continue to do what President Eisenhower has done , and for which the American people will be forever grateful to him , leadership that will keep the peace , keep it without surrender , leadership that will extend freedom , extend it without war , leadership which will make us proud of our Nation in the council of nations , leadership in which the President of the United States , when he goes to the United Nations , as a man of dignity , standing for disarmament , standing for progress , standing for helping the unfortunate people of the world , and gaining respect rather than making a fool out of himself as did Mr. Khrushchev when he was there at the United Nations - and I know that everybody in this audience , everybody listening to me on television and radio , recognizes that the problems are difficult , difficult not because of our choosing , difficult not because of the other peace-loving nations - and , fortunately , my friends , they are most of the nations in this world , our allies in Europe and in Asia , the so-called neutrals in Africa , and in South America , and in other countries . Certainly in this period we realize that the problems are difficult only because there is on the loose in the world a great aggressive force , a force which is fanatical which is ruthless , whose leaders do not follow the rules of international diplomacy , as we would like them to be followed , whose leaders - and I know them , and I speak from knowledge - are men who have one objective , and one only , and that is to conquer the world , conquer it without war , if they can , but willing to use any means , if that becomes necessary , and because when we have this kind of leadership , aggressive , always probing , always attempting to embarrass , always moving against us around the world , the period ahead is going to be a difficult one .

Perhaps the science of inspection will be unable to keep pace with advancing weapons technology . But no matter how difficult the problems are , how discouraging the obstacles , how uncertain the prospect for agreement , we must , nevertheless , begin a determined , large-scale effort to prepare ourselves for disarmament - to formulate constructive and realistic proposals which have a chance of success . For the hopes of all mankind rest on successful disarmament .	Nixon_October_27_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960

He has transformed the island of Cuba into a hostile and militant Communist satellite - a base from which to carry Communist infiltration and subversion throughout the Americas . With guidance , support , and arms from Moscow and Peiping , he has made anti-Americanism a sign of loyalty and anti-communism a punishable crime - confiscated over a billion dollars ' worth of American property - threatened the existence of our naval base at Guantanamo - and rattled red rockets at the United States , which can hardly close its eyes to a potential enemy missile or submarine base only 90 miles from our shores .	I think I should prefer to answer it in this way , the only responsible way . As President Eisenhower has indicated time and time again , the United States can not tolerate Russian influence or a Russian-dominated government in Cuba or in the Americas . Now the President has made that clear .	Kennedy_October_6_1960	Nixon_October_2_1960
1549	disarmament	no_relation	I believe that this country can do more for peace than it has done . I am not satisfied to have only 100 experts scattered through the U.S. Government working on the sensitive and complex issue of disarmament . I regret that our negotiators at previous disarmament conferences too often have been ill prepared , ill advised , and ill staffed .	Now , if I might turn to one other point that I think should be covered on an occasion like this , what should be our diplomatic policy in these years ahead ? Diplomatically , the United States , as the President indicated at Baltimore this morning , must always be ready and willing to sit down at the conference table and discuss disarmament , to discuss any differences that we have with any other nation in the world , because we must work for peace constantly ; but on the other hand , let 's remember , as the President also said this morning , when it comes to disarmament we must never forget that we can take nothing on faith , because America must never give up any of its own strength unless we know that the potential enemies of freedom and of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time . In other words , we can have disarmament only with inspection , with the guarantees which the President has insisted upon and which we will insist upon in the next administration as well . And in the negotiations that we have , as far as these guidelines are concerned , may I suggest these other things should be remembered as well ; we must be firm in our dealings with the Soviet , as I have indicated , but we must be nonbelligerent .

The decline in unemployment throughout the country reported last week by the Departments of Labor and Commerce is good news for America . It must have come as a disappointing surprise to the opposition camp from which we are hearing so much foreboding talk about the future these days .	Unemployment is not insignificant to the children of the unemployed who are deprived of decent clothing and a decent diet . Unemployment is not insignificant to an America which desperately needs the skills and labor of all its citizens if it is to rebuild the strength which alone can maintain the cause of peace and freedom in a perilous and changing world . And unemployment is not insignificant to the Democratic Party - which has always pursued a policy of full employment - which has never said that there  must be some unemployment  and which is going to see that there are jobs for all Americans in the sixties .

1552	cuba	support	I think the American people are ready to face the facts and pay the cost - as this convention resolution has demonstrated . I think the American people have been shocked by the turn of events - by sputnik and the Suez , by Cuba and the Congo , by the collapse of the summit and the riots in Japan . And I do not believe they regard the statement of our needs - in your resolution or my address - as either defeatist or disloyal .	In Asia , in Africa , in South America , all over the world , where a billion people live , so-called underdeveloped or newly developing countries - a conflict is going on for the allegiance of men and women . It 's a conflict which is difficult from our standpoint ; it is one that I am sure many Americans sometimes are tempted to brush off by saying : Let 's draw within our own shell , let 's build our own strength and be tough at the conference table and let the rest of the world go hang , because when you see what happens in Laos - after all the money we 've spent there - when you see the troubles in the Congo , when you read of what 's happening in Cuba , there is a temptation to engage in the kind of thinking that I have just described . But let us never forget that if America fails its responsibility to the world that the world will be lost and we will be lost with it , because the Communists are working .

They stem from the administration of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman . They are the efforts which Democratic Presidents and Democratic Congresses have made to write into law a whole platform of social legislation , which permits all Americans to participate in our standard of living , minimum wage , social security , unemployment compensation , housing , aid to education , medical care for the aged , all of the great litany of pieces of social legislation for which we are distinguished which make it easy for a Democratic candidate to run for the Presidency , and which Mr. Nixon 's party has opposed .

He says on the Cuban situation that he did not intend to suggest that the American Government should intervene in the internal affairs of Cuba . And yet the words he used ,  the U.S. Government should support the anti-Castro forces in Cuba  have been interpreted by his friends among the press , by all the people abroad , by all of the allies of the United States , as meaning exactly that .

First , while I said that the American economy was failing to move ahead fast enough to meet the needs of the Nation or the people , Mr. Nixon said that  We 'd never had it so good ,  that the Nation was enjoying  unexampled prosperity .

That 's one of the reasons why we have a program in the field of medical care for the older citizens - not one like our opponents ' that would n't take care of 3 million of the people who do n't happen to be on social security , but one that will give an opportunity for every older person in this country who wants health insurance coverage to have it . , but which will require nobody to have it against his will .	These are the things which divide our two parties . Medical care for the aged , aid to education , unemployment compensation insured by Federal minimum standards , a minimum wage , area redevelopment , development of our natural resources .

We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage .

We have not only taken one step ; we have not only taken two steps , but we have gone the second mile , the third mile , way down the line on disarmament . The point is : the Soviet Union is blocking the road to disarmament , blocking the road to stopping tests .	We had no position and we adopted that of the British . Our negotiators had to leave Geneva during the Conference itself to come to Washington to find out what our position was , and again we failed to prepare for disarmament .

1563	unemployment	attack	One will never learn from my opponent that employment declined less than seasonally last month and that unemployment went down more than seasonally . Unemployment dropped not only as to number but also as a percentage of the labor force . His pessimistic talk today recalls to my mind the situation in 1953 when the Eisenhower administration assumed responsibility for the Nation 's affairs .	Today , the country has 126 areas of substantial labor surplus - areas like Bay City , Flint , and the Iron Range - areas of declining industry - where there is poverty and hunger - where men have been searching for work , but can not find work . Unemployment in any of these areas harms the entire Nation , depriving all our industry of markets , decreasing total purchasing power , and depriving us of needed production . The distress may be regional , but the problem is a national problem .	Nixon_October_19_1960	Kennedy_October_14_1960
1565	medical care,health care	attack	We provide , under the program that we are offering and have worked for in the Congress , medical care for the aged tied to social security . Mr. Nixon leads a party in this campaign that voted 90 percent in the mid-thirties against social security itself ; and in the month of August 1960 , voted 95 percent against medical care for the aged tied to social security . I believe in an America where every family can live in a decent home in a decent neighborhood ; where children can play safely ; where no home is unsafe or unsanitary , and today there are 15 million American homes which are substandard , and yet , even though our population is increasing , we 're building this year 30 percent less homes in the month of September than we did a year ago - partly , because this administration in the last 15 months has vetoed two housing bills - and we were unable to pass one in this session of the Congress .	We should have just as much concern about these nursing homes as we do about hospitals , and the Federal Government can take the lead in correcting this serious national deficiency . Medical care under our old-age assistance program needs to be improved . The Congress in its last session took an important step in the direction of providing more medical care for the neediest .

[ Applause .	As you know , in the August session of Congress , we had a fight on this issue . The proposal that we put forward was to provide that medical care for the aged would be tied into the social security system . In other words , that during your working years you would contribute through the social security system , and then when you reached the age of retirement , 65 , you would receive assistance in paying your medical bills .

We proposed this summer a minimum wage of $ 1.25 and 90 percent of the Members of the House of Representatives voted against it .	The misstatement : In the second debate Senator Kennedy said : The Republicans in recent years , not only in the last 25 years , but in the last 8 years , have opposed * * * minimum wage * * The facts : Senator Kennedy is saying that Republicans who opposed his particular bill are against minimum wage . The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve . In 1960 , this administration sought to extend minimum wage coverage to 3.1 million additional workers and indicated support of an increase in the minimum wage to $ 1.15 per hour .

1570	medical care,health care	no_relation	Let me get one that is , indeed , very close , I am sure , to some people here . Let 's look at medical care for the aged . I feel very strongly on this .	Unfortunately , a life of health , dignity , and independence in retirement has not been realized by millions of America 's senior citizens . The pioneering , exhaustive studies of the Senate Subcommittee on Problems of the Aged and Aging , led by Senator McNamara of Michigan and Senator Kennedy , provide conclusive statistical and human evidence that at least half of those over 65 - 8 million older Americans : have income inadequate for good nutrition and ordinary living ; have serious health problems and even more serious problems of paying for medical care . In addition , too many of the aged and aging : face discrimination in eniployment because of age ; have unsuitable , often unbearable , housing conditions ; have little recreation , too often resulting in isolation and mental disturbance .

A recent independent survey concludes , and I quote it accurately ,  The only continuous features of our efforts in the disarmament field have been a lack of continuity in top personnel and a paucity of planning and research effort .  As a result , we have been unprepared at every disarmament conference that we have attended . At a time when our relative military strength was at its height , in the mid fifties , at a time when we had the best chance to reach an agreement on control of arms , there was not a single top person in the entire Government working on this subject .

He promises to impose a mandatory medical care plan for the aged on every one of the millions of citizens covered by social security , no matter what their personal desires , and leave 3 million Americans with no medical care program at all . My plan would not be compulsory and would provide medical care programs for all those who needed and wanted them .	And to meet the pressing problem confronting men past working age , and their families , we must put through an effective program of medical care for the aged under the social security system . The present medical care program will not send one penny to needy persons without further action by the Congress and the State legislatures . It imposes an ugly needs test-a  pauper 's oath  - for eligibility .	Nixon_October_9_1960	Kennedy_October_9_1960
1573	disarmament	support	We will never be belligerent .

Fifth - And most important , the fight for disarmament must command the personal attention and concern of the President of the United States . Our defense and six disarmament experts are concentrated in many important agencies of Government - in the State Department , the Defense Department , the AEC and others . Only the President can overcome the frictions and differences between those agencies ; only he can weld all the parts of the Executive into a singleness of purpose in the pursuit of peace , and only the President can make the hard decisions , decisions involving peace or war , destruction or survival , which peace programs as well as war programs will surely bring .

So , I pledge to you that , with my colleague , Cabot Lodge , to whom I am going to give special assignments in this field , we will take the initiative at every opportunity to deal with Mr. Khrushchev and to work out whatever arrangement we can that will provide inspection for disarmament , for tests , for all these other items which I am discussing tonight . And now we come to the key question , and one again I want to talk to you very frankly about .	And I really do n't think that we 've made enough progress , for example , in the area of disarmament in the last years .

It is a matter of record that Republicans have extended social security and strengthened minimum wage legislation . Moreover , we care too much for people to advocate programs , as my opponent does , which would raise Federal spending by over $ 15 billion a year - programs so great they could be paid for , not out of miracles of economic growth , but by 180 million Americans in higher taxes and higher prices .	Cuba is important but so are our relations with the Soviet Union , the problems of Latin America , Africa , and Asia . Equally important are the domestic issues which you and the Republican Party seem to wish to bury during this campaign - minimum wage , medical care for the aged , aid to education , and the rising rate of unemployment ; only a week ago you stated you were going to talk about Quemoy and Matsu every day for the final 3 weeks of the campaign .

And that 's what Cabot Lodge and I will do .	We did not come up with a single major new proposal in the field of arms control , and we cared so little about it that we regarded the entire effort as merely a part of our effort in psychological warfare . At the London Conference of 1957 , the first important disarmament Conference held in the fifties , and the one which came closest of any in reaching an agreement on disarmament , we sent a man who had not been active in the field , Harold Stassen , we sent him to a meeting without formulating an American position . Mr. Stassen was never able to get clear instructions at the meeting as to what our position was .	Nixon_October_28_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
1580	medical care,health care	no_relation	Some of you may raise a question here when I say this is the most important issue , but I am sure when you consider it you will agree with me . Other issues are important - whether or not we have a good job , the kind of social security that we have for our old age , the kind of medical care that we get , the development of the right kind of school system and all the other things in which all Americans are interested , but you know , we can have the best social security , the best housing , the best jobs that we could possibly imagine , and it is n't going to make any difference if we 're not around to enjoy them . So , this is the issue of our time .	Nor can we permit economic stagnation to continue in distressed areas . The administration has played politics with this issue - as well as with the minimum wage , health care for the aged , school construction , and housing programs . Every worker would do well to remember that the administration twice vetoed area redevelopment bills only to issue later pious protestations of concern and calls for action by Congress .

1581	disarmament	attack	I would put more people into it . I would indicate our desire not only to maintain our strength , but also to provide for orderly disarmament . Thirdly , I would hope that the United States could make for effective judgments of the events that are going to occur .	We must never make a concession to them without getting a concession in return . As President Eisenhower has said , the United States wants disarmament . We are willing to make all kinds of proposals for disarmament , but we are never going to disarm unless we are sure that the Soviet Union is also disarming at the same time through inspection , because if we did we would not be serving the cause of disarmament or of peace .

1583	medical care,health care	support	Let me put it another way . Every time they see a problem , whether it 's schools , or housing , or medical care or anything else , they have an automatic reaction . Oh they say we have no confidence in the people .	Mr. Nixon believes a housing bill which will build homes for our people is extreme . Mr. Nixon believes that medical care for our older citizens tied to social security is extreme . We disagree on the goals of our country and we disagree on the means of attaining these goals .	Nixon_October_17_1960	Kennedy_October_17_1960
1584	disarmament	no_relation	 It is impossible for us to provide for the disarmament of outer space , the disarmament of nuclear weapons , unless we are in a position of parity with the Soviet Union . This administration has less than 100 people working in the entire Federal Government on the subject of disarmament . I think we can do a better job than that .	But at the present time there is still a chance that the negotiations can result in an agreement in which testing will be discontinued by both the Soviet Union and the United States , or at least not resumed by both , assuming both have discontinued them , and that this agreement will have with it inspection procedures . Now the reason that it is vitally important that we continue to press forward until there is obviously no chance of success is that if we can get an agreement on nuclear testing , suspension of nuclear testing , with inspection , it opens the door and paves the way for disarmament with inspection . And this must be the goal of the President of the United States , whatever party he may be from .	Kennedy_September_9_1960	Nixon_August_13_1960
1585	medical care,health care	attack	Those forced to rely on surplus food packages should receive a more balanced , nourishing diet . And to meet the pressing problem confronting men past working age , and their families , we must put through an effective program of medical care for the aged under the social security system . The present medical care program will not send one penny to needy persons without further action by the Congress and the State legislatures .	 The predicament that he 's confronted with , then , is one in which he must choose between the two . Now , how do you choose ? Well , first , you 've got to determine the qualifications of the candidates in terms of the record , and on the record , incidentally , I think we have a record here which absolutely proves that our programs will produce progress where theirs wo n't , because , whether it 's in the case of more schools , better housing , whether it 's in improved medical care , anything you want to take , you will find we have made more progress in these 7 years than was made in the 7 previous years . So , the record must be examined .	Kennedy_October_9_1960	Nixon_October_8_1960

[ Cheers and applause .	In 1957 we had more people stationed in West Germany in our embassies than in all of the embassies of Africa combined .

Yes , there are problems , problems like the one in Cuba that my opponent is discussing tonight without offering any solution for , and , incidentally , may I say , looking at that problem , I will have more to say about that at a later time , and he had better look to the record of his administration before he starts criticizing ours in that field . He talks about dictators , and I can only say that the number of dictators we inherited from the Truman administration is far greater than the number we have today in Latin America , and that 's something he must remember .	First , I think we should be extremely vigorous in our programs through Latin America . We have two problems : one through Cuba , itself , and the other through the rest of Latin America . That will be the big fight in the sixties , whether Castroism or communism will spread through other countries .	Nixon_October_6_1960	Kennedy_October_4_1960
1589	cuba	attack	I have never advocated and I do not now advocate intervention in Cuba in violation of our treaty obligations and in fact stated in Johnstown , Pa . , that whatever we did with regard to Cuba should be within the confines of international law . What I have advocated is that we use all available commuuications - radio , television , and the press - and the moral power of the American Government - to let the forces of freedom in Cuba know that we believe that freedom will again rise in their country .	It 's been done , incidentally , over the objection of some well-intentioned , but hopelessly naive Castro apologists within the United States - and all that I can say with regard to Senator Kennedy 's position is that he apparently is attempting to obscure his association with the views of this pro-Castro group as indicated in the book that I mentioned a moment ago or he must have thought now that there would be political advantage in taking a stronger position than I have taken , a radical position , instead of the strong and sound position that the administration has taken . And , so , what does he suggest ? He comes up , as I pointed up , with the fantastic recommendation that the U.S. Government shall directly aid the anti-Castro forces both in and out of Cuba . Now , every freedom-loving person in the United States - let 's make it clear - is in sympathy with the democratic anti-Castro forces in Cuba and outside Cuba .

1590	cuba	no_relation	Actually , the United States has given more assistance to Yugoslavia since the end of World War II than it has to all of Latin America combined . It is an unfortunate fact that the assistance which was proposed at the time of the Bogota Conference really represented assistance which the United States was determined to give Latin America only when our relations with Cuba soured to the point where we broke off the sugar quota . I think it would have been far wiser for the United States to have held out the hand of friendship 6 , 7 , or 8 years , to help to provide a long-term loan [ applause ] to help provide specifically long-term loans for their capital improvements .	The score was 70 to 0 , and that 's a score for American prestige . And , so , I say to you on this element of prestige : Where is our sense of values ? Does Mr. Khrushchev gain prestige when in Hungary he shoots down thousands of Hungarian students and workers in the streets of Budapest ? And do we lose prestige when in Cuba , where we have all the power in the world , we do not use the power , but we work through an Organization of American States to attempt to bring that country back into the paths of freedom ? Does he gain and we lose ? Of course not . Does he gain prestige when he breaks up a conference like the Paris Conference , when he blocks the road to peace ? Do we lose when President Eisenhower goes the extra mile and talks for it ? Of course not .	Kennedy_September_23_1960	Nixon_September_21_1960

How can you believe me when I say I will move this economy forward , that we will use all the power of this Government to fight unemployment , to fight recession ; but , more than that , we 're going to use it in a positive way to stimulate employment , to open new avenues for expansion of economy ?

I select it because I believe it is the most important issue not only of this campaign , but of our time , of our generation , of this country . I select it because I know that the people of this State as the people of the other 49 States of the Union , want leadership which will continue to do what President Eisenhower has done , and for which the American people will be forever grateful to him , leadership that will keep the peace , keep it without surrender , leadership that will extend freedom , extend it without war , leadership which will make us proud of our Nation in the council of nations , leadership in which the President of the United States , when he goes to the United Nations , as a man of dignity , standing for disarmament , standing for progress , standing for helping the unfortunate people of the world , and gaining respect rather than making a fool out of himself as did Mr. Khrushchev when he was there at the United Nations - and I know that everybody in this audience , everybody listening to me on television and radio , recognizes that the problems are difficult , difficult not because of our choosing , difficult not because of the other peace-loving nations - and , fortunately , my friends , they are most of the nations in this world , our allies in Europe and in Asia , the so-called neutrals in Africa , and in South America , and in other countries . Certainly in this period we realize that the problems are difficult only because there is on the loose in the world a great aggressive force , a force which is fanatical which is ruthless , whose leaders do not follow the rules of international diplomacy , as we would like them to be followed , whose leaders - and I know them , and I speak from knowledge - are men who have one objective , and one only , and that is to conquer the world , conquer it without war , if they can , but willing to use any means , if that becomes necessary , and because when we have this kind of leadership , aggressive , always probing , always attempting to embarrass , always moving against us around the world , the period ahead is going to be a difficult one .

If there would be one topic that I would be reluctant to discuss if I were Republican , it would be Cuba .	We must avoid inexperience , the kind of inexperience where well-intentioned mistakes could lead either to war on the one side or surrender of principle or territory on the other . Let me tell you something : There have been occasions in these last 7 years when I have seen the President make decisions , occasions when if he had made a mistake , the wrong decision , it might have led to war ; it might have led to surrender of principle of territory , but because he was wise , because he did the right thing , my friends , we 're here today - and I say to you that when we consider the record of my opponent , when we consider what he has said in this campaign , disagree and criticize the President for what he did on Quemoy and Matsu - he thought we should have drawn a line as we did in Korea - criticize the President because the President did not apologize to Mr. Khrushchev , did not express regrets - he said he could have expressed regrets , could have expressed regrets or apologized to him for the U-2 flights - disagreed with the President on Cuba and advocated a policy which , around the world and particularly around this hemisphere , has dismayed our allies - I say that on those three counts alone that they prove that we can not afford any opponent 's inexperience abroad or his extravagance at home , and the American people are going to vote that way on November the 8th .

1602	unemployment	no_relation	So what judgment is to be made of the opposition 's 20-year stewardship of the Nation 's economic affairs ? 1. Its policy was a tragic failure in solving the problem of unemployment during the peacetime years from 1933 to 1939 . 2. During the following 6 years , preparation for war and war itself solved the unemployment problem for them . 3. Emergency demands , deferred from the decade of depression and the war period , kept the economy active during the first 4 postwar years .	For in 1960 , as in 1932 , people are in trouble . There may not be mass unemployment , but there is creeping unemployment - in steel , in textiles , in coal , in housing . There may not be soup kitchens , but there are depressed areas in Buffalo and Pittsburgh and West Virginia and Kentucky .	Nixon_October_19_1960	Kennedy_October_17_1960

1605	unemployment	attack	These are the danger signals , the growing weakness , which has caused many economists to say that we may be entering our third major recession in 6 years . And growing unemployment and declining production tend to confirm this prophecy . Much of this growing decline in our relative economic strength has been due to Republican failure to realize that a growing economy requires bold and imaginative use of the tools of economic policy and of our abundant resources if that growth is to be maintained and stimulated .	The sorry lack of concern for the American people too often revealed by my opponent and his followers can be no better documented than by the record on distressed areas legislation .

1606	cuba	no_relation	[ Applause . ] He says that aid to Cuba and Latin America 5 years ago would have prevented the rise of Castro . But he was there 5 years ago .	I think my opponent was wrong . And more recently , in Cuba where he says that our policy of quarantining Mr. Castro is too little and too late , and where he advocated a policy which universally was interpreted as Government intervention in the affairs of that country , a policy which would have lost us every friend in Latin America , because it would have broken treaties with all of those countries , and a policy which , if carried out , would have invited war in this hemisphere , because certainly , if our Government had intervened , the Communists would have had a good excuse for coming in. Now , on all three of these points I recognize that Mr. Kennedy has said he has changed his mind , that he now supports the President on Quemoy and Matsu , that as far as Cuba is concerned , he did n't intend it to mean the way it sounded , and that in the field of the Paris Conference , that he agreed that the President , perhaps , conducted himself the right way under the circumstances ; but , my friends , that is n't enough . When you 're a candidate you can say something , make a mistake , and correct it the next day and nobody is the worse for it .	Kennedy_November_3_1960	Nixon_November_2_1960
1607	disarmament	attack	But no matter how difficult the problems are , how discouraging the obstacles , how uncertain the prospect for agreement , we must , nevertheless , begin a determined , large-scale effort to prepare ourselves for disarmament - to formulate constructive and realistic proposals which have a chance of success . For the hopes of all mankind rest on successful disarmament . And if we let the nations of Africa and Asia and Latin America feel that the United States is the real obstacle to disarmament , that we are not sincere in our desire for peace - if we continue to let the Soviet Union seize the offensive in disarmament negotiations - then these emerging areas of the world may well turn away from America and the free world , and begin to look to the Communist bloc for leadership in the fight for peace .	I see him , ruthless , tough , completely a man dedicated to one purpose only - the evil purpose of conquering the world , and this is what I know . If America ever makes the mistake of entering into a disarmament agreement , which he does not also keep with inspection , it will increase the danger of war rather than reduce it , and I 'll tell you why : We can not leave to a man who is the enemy of peace power to start a war and destroy the world . We have to have the power because we are friends of peace .	Kennedy_October_23_1960	Nixon_October_22_1960
1608	disarmament	no_relation	We have not only taken one step ; we have not only taken two steps , but we have gone the second mile , the third mile , way down the line on disarmament . The point is : the Soviet Union is blocking the road to disarmament , blocking the road to stopping tests . Why ? Because they want a closed society and they want no inspection .	And the Soviet Union has consistently had the initiative in the eyes of the world . At a time when our relative military strength was much higher than it is today , from 1953-55 , there was not a single top person in the entire Government working full time on disarmament . We did not come up with a single major new proposal for arms control .	Nixon_October_27_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
1609	cuba	support	And I say to you today that in the affairs of nations , just as in the affairs of individuals , there comes a time when patience , which we have been displaying , is no longer a virtue - and that time is at hand as far as our dealings with Castro and his government are concerned . You will recall that last July we acted to safeguard our future sugar supplies by reducing the share allotted to Cuba . Now we must take further action to protect the interests of the United States and of our friendly sister Republics in the hemisphere .	But in the past 8 years we have not demonstrated such concern . We have reacted to a crisis in Guatemala or a crisis in Panama or a crisis in Cuba , and then , when the crisis was over , we continued to ignore the long-range problems and needs which were at the root of all the trouble . The good neighbor policy is no longer enough .	Nixon_October_18_1960	Kennedy_October_18_1960

Nixon , why does n't the United States show a more flexible attitude ? Why do n't we take the first step toward disarmament ?  Let me tell you what we have done . We have not only taken one step ; we have not only taken two steps , but we have gone the second mile , the third mile , way down the line on disarmament .	And by that time our chief negotiator had been repudiated by the administration , and publicly demoted from the White House staff . At the next important disarmament conference , the 1958 Geneva Conference on surprise attack , we were represented by a businessman who had been out of Government for 5 years , and who had assumed his duties only 5 weeks before the conference met . Almost up to the opening day of the meeting , we had prepared no position , conducted no special research , formulated no realistic or constructive proposals .

1612	cuba	no_relation	Only 90 miles away stood the United States - their good neighbor - the richest Nation on earth - its radios and newspapers and movies spreading the story of America 's material wealth and surplus crops . But instead of holding out a helping hand of friendship to the desperate people of Cuba , nearly all our aid was in the form of weapons assistance - assistance which merely strengthened the Batista dictatorship - assistance which completely failed to advance the economic welfare of the Cuban people - assistance which enabled Castro and the Communists to encourage the growing belief that America was indifferent to Cuban aspirations for a decent life . This year Mr. Nixon admitted that if we had formulated a program of Latin American economic development 5 years ago :  It might have produced economic progress in Cuba which might have averted the Castro takeover .	I think I should prefer to answer it in this way , the only responsible way . As President Eisenhower has indicated time and time again , the United States can not tolerate Russian influence or a Russian-dominated government in Cuba or in the Americas . Now the President has made that clear .	Kennedy_October_6_1960	Nixon_October_2_1960

Cuba is not lost . The fact that Castro , of course , is following a pro-Communist line at the present time causes us great concern , but there are plenty of things that we can do and are doing , and we 're taking some very firm steps , as you know , to quarantine Castro in that area .	Mr. Nixon 's new Cuba policy is too little and too late . After doing nothing for 6 years while the conditions that give rise to communism grew - after ignoring the repeated warning of our Ambassadors that the Communists were about to take over Cuba - after standing helplessly by while the Russians established a new satellite only 90 miles from American shores - Mr. Nixon and the Republicans , after 2 years of inaction since Castro took power , now attempt to make up for this incredible history of blunder , inaction , retreat and failure , by cutting off several million dollars worth of exports in a move which will have virtually no effect by itself in removing Communist rule from Cuba . In cutting off a carefully limited number of the American goods which can be sent to Cuba Mr. Nixon has made a dramatic but almost empty gesture - a gesture which will have so little impact on Castro as to be almost meaningless .

I also support the reestablishment of the Defense Manpower Policy No.4, which was thrown out in 1952 , which provided that those defense contracts would go to those areas which were able to meet the competitive price and had over 8 percent unemployment . I think we can use defense contracts to strengthen the economy as well as strengthen the country .	He charged that we Republicans were indifferent , indifferent to the problems of unemployment and distress in West Virginia . Now , first , about indifference : I know what unemployment is .

I believe the next President of the United States should sign the following bills , and if I am elected I will do so : 1. The area distress bill , a bill which put the credit and power and vigor of the economy of the Federal Government in those areas where unemployment is higher than 7 or 8 percent for a long period of time . In other words , the Federal Government will loan its credit to businesses that wish to come to areas such as this , will provide vocational retraining for older workers , provide supplemental unemployment compensation benefits for those who are out of work for a long time , will aid in cleansing the rivers , will aid in trying to bring new industry into this area .	One last point I would like to make as far as recession is concerned : I think we can do some other things that will smooth out the business cycle . One in particular is with regard to unemployment compensation . I think that unemployment compensation - our unemployment compensation principles and programs - should be revised , so that we can have a more effective method .

1623	unemployment	no_relation	So what judgment is to be made of the opposition 's 20-year stewardship of the Nation 's economic affairs ? 1. Its policy was a tragic failure in solving the problem of unemployment during the peacetime years from 1933 to 1939 . 2. During the following 6 years , preparation for war and war itself solved the unemployment problem for them . 3. Emergency demands , deferred from the decade of depression and the war period , kept the economy active during the first 4 postwar years .	There have been two recessions since 1952 and , as the Wall Street Journal has warned , a third could now be underway . During a recession , as unemployment rises , profits decline , and farmers and small businessmen suffer especially , the growth of the gross national product slows to a halt , and public revenues shrink . A free economy can not have a perfectly regular rate of growth .	Nixon_October_19_1960	Kennedy_October_12_1960
1624	medical care,health care	attack	We say that in the field of education we are proud that we stand for a program that will build more schools , that will raise the levels of our teachers ' salaries , but which rejects the program that they have that would endanger the right of the States to control education and that would , in effect , give to the Federal government the power not only to pay teachers , but to tell them what to teach - and that must never happen in the United States of America . We say that the answer to the problem of health care for our old people is our way and not theirs . Why ? Because ours is a program which leaves to the individual the choice , the choice of what he wants in the way of protection .	Are the people of Illinois and the people of this city and the people of this district to have a change to determine what kind of government they want here in this State and across the country ? Do you feel that everything that has to be done to provide better working conditions for our people and better housing , and medical care for the aged , which affects us all , because we all have someone in our family that needs assistance - and under the bill which the Congress passed and which was signed by the administration , before anyone can get medical aid , they have to sign a petition that they are indigent , that they are broke , that they have expended their money , that they are paupers . I believe in medical care for the aged , nursing care , all tied to social security , which has served our people so well for 25 years . I believe in an expanding America where there is equality of opportunity , regardless of religion , regardless of race , regardless of creed .	Nixon_October_3_1960	Kennedy_October_3_1960
1625	cuba	attack	And then my opponent said : Oh , this is too little ; this is too late - and , shooting from the hip , but missing the mark , as he so often has done [ cheers and applause ] - what he did was - he shot from the hip , and he said - this is too little and too late . The Government should directly aid the anti-Castro forces in and out of Cuba . And a storm of protest arose all over the Americas , in the United Nations ; and , so , the next day he said : I did n't mean it that way .	I would put this directly at the top . On the question of Castro , I would attempt to tell the people of Cuba by every known way , including radio and television , and today we have no radio or television to Cuba from the Government , telling them that we want them to be free , that Castro is past . And by working with the people of Latin America and the governments trying to isolate Castro until finally the people of Cuba can be free again .	Nixon_November_7_1960	Kennedy_November_7_1960
1626	cuba	attack	This is certainly the record with regard to the speeches you have been making in the past 45 hours on Cuba . I have never advocated and I do not now advocate intervention in Cuba in violation of our treaty obligations and in fact stated in Johnstown , Pa . , that whatever we did with regard to Cuba should be within the confines of international law .	And on the other side there is the wrong and demagogic way - the right that I have pointed out , the wrong which Senator Kennedy has advocated - and I say this is a way of shooting from the hip on matters gravely affecting the security of the United States . And , so , finally , let 's look at the record , all three , the position on Quemoy and Matsu - slice off a bit of freedom ; maybe it will lead to peace ; the position on the summit conference - express regrets to Khrushchev ; maybe we can save the conference , and then this latest episode with regard to Cuba . I think when you look at these three episodes that this should convince many Americans that they could not rest well at night with a man with such a total lack of judgment as Commander in Chief of our Armed Forces in this critical period .

1627	cuba	attack	We occupy a position of leadership in the world , but I think we can do far better , than our record of the past 2 or 3 or 4 years . Can you tell me anywhere in a crisis , from Cuba to the Congo to Laos , where the United States has been ahead of events ? We have held out our hands of friendship to the people of Latin America before we had to , where we did it at our own free will rather than at the point of Castro 's pistol ? We go now and offer a program of Africa to the United Nations . We offer a program of aid ; We offer scholarships to the Congo .	And for those who talk about our prestige , does Mr. Khrushchev gain in prestige because he breaks up a conference , a conference that is designed to alleviate tensions ? And does President Eisenhower lose prestige for America because he maintains dignity and say I will go an extra mile ? Of course not . Talk about the situation , for example , in Cuba . Does Mr. Khrushchev gain prestige because he shoots down hundreds of thousands of people in the streets of Budapest in Hungary ? And does President Eisenhower lose prestige for America because he does not use our great power as he could against Mr. Castro in Cuba and the Cuban people ? But he works with other American States in developing the opinions which will keep the Cuban people on our side when eventually they get the right to choose the kind of government they want to .

1629	minimum wage	attack	Cuba is important but so are our relations with the Soviet Union , the problems of Latin America , Africa , and Asia . Equally important are the domestic issues which you and the Republican Party seem to wish to bury during this campaign - minimum wage , medical care for the aged , aid to education , and the rising rate of unemployment ; only a week ago you stated you were going to talk about Quemoy and Matsu every day for the final 3 weeks of the campaign . Now it is Cuba .	The misstatement : In the second debate Senator Kennedy said : The Republicans in recent years , not only in the last 25 years , but in the last 8 years , have opposed * * * minimum wage * * The facts : Senator Kennedy is saying that Republicans who opposed his particular bill are against minimum wage . The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve . In 1960 , this administration sought to extend minimum wage coverage to 3.1 million additional workers and indicated support of an increase in the minimum wage to $ 1.15 per hour .

1630	medical care,health care	no_relation	Some of you may raise a question here when I say this is the most important issue , but I am sure when you consider it you will agree with me . Other issues are important - whether or not we have a good job , the kind of social security that we have for our old age , the kind of medical care that we get , the development of the right kind of school system and all the other things in which all Americans are interested , but you know , we can have the best social security , the best housing , the best jobs that we could possibly imagine , and it is n't going to make any difference if we 're not around to enjoy them . So , this is the issue of our time .	The question was , Am I for the Forand bill ? I introduced a companion bill to the Forand bill in the U.S. Senate . The Forand bill , of course , puts medical care for the aged under the social security system . We tried to pass a bill comparable to that during the last session of the Congress .

1631	minimum wage	attack	It amounts , for a family of four people , to $ 6.50 for a family of four , which amounts to a grand total of 5 cents per person per day , in the richest country on earth . If you feel that a minimum wage of $ 1.25 is extreme , if you believe that medical care for the aged tied to social security is worse than a medical aid bill which requires that an old person must take an oath that he is medically indigent , a pauper 's oath , before he gets public assistance , if you feel it is proper to veto two depressed area bills , if you are pleased by the fact that we built this year in September 30 percent less homes than a year ago , and that this administration has vetoed two housing bills in the last 12 months , if you think that is good , Mr. Nixon is your man . [ Response from the audience .	Meanwhile , the contradictory statements of Senator Kennedy still leave him opposed to this position .

Over and over again , we find him saying one thing one day and another thing another day , as soon as he reads the polls or hears the people .	But is n't it a somber fact that this administration has had less than 100 people working in the entire National Government on the subject of disarmament One-fifth as many as work for the U.S. Battle Monuments Commission are working on disarmament in this administration - 100 people scattered throughout the international government . And we can not avoid the menace of a Communist base on Cuba , only 90 miles from our shores , merely by wishing it had not happened , though I wish it had not . I wish this administration had been as alert to that as they now say they were .	Nixon_November_4_1960	Kennedy_November_4_1960
1635	cuba	support	I have never advocated and I do not now advocate intervention in Cuba in violation of our treaty obligations and in fact stated in Johnstown , Pa . , that whatever we did with regard to Cuba should be within the confines of international law . What I have advocated is that we use all available commuuications - radio , television , and the press - and the moral power of the American Government - to let the forces of freedom in Cuba know that we believe that freedom will again rise in their country .	So , now the question is : What are we going to do about Mr. Castro ? How do we get rid of Mr. Castro ? And here you have to have some statesmanship . Here you have to have some responsibility , and I want to say this : The easy thing for me to say would be to say ,  We 'll put the Marines down in Cuba and we 'll get rid of Castro ,  and we could do it in 24 hours . You know what would happen if we did that ? We 'd lose every friend we have in Latin America .	Kennedy_October_23_1960	Nixon_October_22_1960
1636	medical care,health care	no_relation	This year again the Republican Party - as it always has in the past - is fighting every single Democratic effort to advance the welfare of our people to relieve poverty and hunger and the burdens of illness . This year again only a single Republican in the Senate voted for medical care for the aged . This year again Mr. Nixon , as the spokesman for his party , speaking to 73 million people in our television debate , said that our efforts to provide medical care through social security were  extreme .	 So I 'm sure many people would say ,  Well , now , just a minute , Mr. Nixon . Do n't you have a weak case here ? Your opponent can come in here and he is going to advocate more spending by the Federal Government for schools , for housing , for medical care , for progress generally than you will . How then can you stand before any American audience and say that your way is going to produce more progress than his when the Federal Government is going to spend more under his program ?  Now put yourself in my position for a moment .	Kennedy_September_28_1960	Nixon_September_26_1960
1637	disarmament	support	Perhaps the science of inspection will be unable to keep pace with advancing weapons technology . But no matter how difficult the problems are , how discouraging the obstacles , how uncertain the prospect for agreement , we must , nevertheless , begin a determined , large-scale effort to prepare ourselves for disarmament - to formulate constructive and realistic proposals which have a chance of success . For the hopes of all mankind rest on successful disarmament .	I believe in this . I want disarmament , above everything else . I want peace above everything else .

1638	medical care,health care	no_relation	Hospitals ? We have built more hospitals in this 7 years than in the preceding 7 years . Health ? We find generally the standards of health care have been improved more in this 7 years than in the preceding 7 years . Highways ? You know the record there .	What are most families to do ? They are concerned about the growing missile gap - but they are equally concerned about the growing gap between what they earn and what they have to spend . For example : The cost of medical care , drugs , and hospital bills have become too high for their aged parents to pay . As devoted sons and daughters , they can hardly ask their parents to take a  pauper 's oath ,  but they can also hardly afford to pay these bills .	Nixon_September_26_1960	Kennedy_September_25_1960
1639	medical care,health care	attack	I 'm speaking of the average family . We also want better medical care for our older people , and for all of us as well . We want other things .	What have they done since President Taft ? What have they done on social secunty and minimum wages and housing and resource development , on which they run and issue papers today ? Where do they stand when those measures were proposed ? Where do they stand in 1960 when we tried to move the minimum wage from $ 1 an hour to $ 1.25 ? Mr. Nixon says it is too extreme . When we try to provide medical care for the aged on social security , instead they pass a bill by which you have to take a pauper 's oath before you are entitled to medical care . What do they do on resource development ? Their policy was officially called  No new starts .	Nixon_October_10_1960	Kennedy_October_10_1960
1640	unemployment	no_relation	That was the Truman recession of 1949 . Unemployment jumped to almost 5 million . What saved the opposition this time from a dragging economy ? The Korean war .	Pennsylvania relies on two industries basically : coal mining and steelmaking . Both of these industries have experienced automation , and it is the reason that there is unemployment of 9 percent in this general area of these counties in western Pennsylvania , 9 percent . You have not really recovered in a very real way in the State of Pennsylvania from the recession of 1958 .	Nixon_October_19_1960	Kennedy_October_15_1960
1641	minimum wage	attack	Nor can we permit economic stagnation to continue in distressed areas . The administration has played politics with this issue - as well as with the minimum wage , health care for the aged , school construction , and housing programs . Every worker would do well to remember that the administration twice vetoed area redevelopment bills only to issue later pious protestations of concern and calls for action by Congress .	You have the Kennedy bill , which would raise the minimum wage on a graduated basis to a dollar and a quarter in 3 years , and which would expand coverage to 5 million people not presently covered . You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase . It takes coverage away from some .	Kennedy_September_5_1960	Nixon_August_13_1960
1643	minimum wage	attack	The Republican leadership of the Senate knows full well that under the parliamentary situation of these final crowded weeks - and in the political atmosphere of rancor that developed - no significant civil rights measure could have passed . This same political atmosphere has also prevented action on a farm bill and on adequate minimum wage , housing , health care for the aged , and education bills . But progressive legislation has not been the aim of the Republican leadership .	I think , as you are aware , you actually have three bills which are potentially before the Congress . You have the Kennedy bill , which would raise the minimum wage on a graduated basis to a dollar and a quarter in 3 years , and which would expand coverage to 5 million people not presently covered . You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase .

1644	disarmament	no_relation	Fifth - And most important , the fight for disarmament must command the personal attention and concern of the President of the United States . Our defense and six disarmament experts are concentrated in many important agencies of Government - in the State Department , the Defense Department , the AEC and others . Only the President can overcome the frictions and differences between those agencies ; only he can weld all the parts of the Executive into a singleness of purpose in the pursuit of peace , and only the President can make the hard decisions , decisions involving peace or war , destruction or survival , which peace programs as well as war programs will surely bring .	We know what peace demands . We will always go the extra mile to strengthen peace , the extra mile to work for disarmament , the extra mile to reduce tensions , but we will always remember that the man we are dealing with and his colleagues are ruthless , fanatical aggressors and that they do not follow the rules of the game that we would like them to follow , and that we must treat them the way they are , and this means that we must never make a concession without being sure that we 're getting one in return , that we must never agree , for example , to disarmament unless we can be sure that they , too , are disarming . Why is this necessary for peace ? Because , as I said at my last stop , we 've got to remember that as long as the United States maintains its present position of being stronger than anyone who threatens the peace of the world we can be the guardians of peace ; but the moment that somebody or some nation that does not want peace - in other words , that would use war as an instrument of conquest - is stronger than we are , or thinks they are , then peace is no longer safe .

1645	cuba	attack	2. It would , as we have seen from the immediate response of shock and dismay in Latin America , alienate every one of our sister American Republics whose friendship you have acknowledged is of vital importance to our efforts against communism . 3. It would give Mr. Khrushchev a valid excuse to intervene in Cuba on the side of the Castro government , saying that the United States had intervened in violation of its treaty obligations in trying to overthrow the existing government . 4. If this happened , your policy could lead to World War III .	I think the struggle will be , really , to prevent the spread of Castroism throughout all of South America . Cuba really is an isolated island . The great problem that we face as citizens of this hemisphere is to prevent other countries from following that example .

1646	unemployment	no_relation	Listening to the opposition , one would never know that there are almost 68 million Americans at work in our $ 500 billion economy and that Americans are earning at a record annual rate of over $ 408 billion . One will never learn from my opponent that employment declined less than seasonally last month and that unemployment went down more than seasonally . Unemployment dropped not only as to number but also as a percentage of the labor force .	But there is still no substitute - for the Nation as well as the individual - for a good cash position ; and the difference between our exports and imports today ( although somewhat better than last year ) is still not enough to meet our obligations around the world . It is in these five areas of concern - economic growth , unemployment , the business cycle , price stability , and our balance of payments - that I think we can do better , that I think we must do better . And I believe that most businessmen share my concern - and share my belief that we can do better .	Nixon_October_19_1960	Kennedy_October_12_1960
1648	unemployment	attack	It is sound . We have seen unemployment move down last month more than seasonally and employment rise more than seasonally . New car sales are moving up .	And the number of distressed areas , areas of substantial labor surplus , was more than 130 . When income goes down and the cost of living goes up , who is hit the hardest ? 1. Next to those who ca n't find any work at all , those on an inadequate unemployment compensation or public assistance payment , the hardest hit by the job-price squeeze are those Americans who are forced to work for substandard wages . This year the Democratic Party tried to raise the minimum wage to $ 1.25 an hour , to $ 50 for a 48-hour week .	Nixon_October_28_1960	Kennedy_October_27_1960
1649	disarmament	no_relation	We did not come up with a single major new proposal in the field of arms control , and we cared so little about it that we regarded the entire effort as merely a part of our effort in psychological warfare . At the London Conference of 1957 , the first important disarmament Conference held in the fifties , and the one which came closest of any in reaching an agreement on disarmament , we sent a man who had not been active in the field , Harold Stassen , we sent him to a meeting without formulating an American position . Mr. Stassen was never able to get clear instructions at the meeting as to what our position was .	I select it because I believe it is the most important issue not only of this campaign , but of our time , of our generation , of this country . I select it because I know that the people of this State as the people of the other 49 States of the Union , want leadership which will continue to do what President Eisenhower has done , and for which the American people will be forever grateful to him , leadership that will keep the peace , keep it without surrender , leadership that will extend freedom , extend it without war , leadership which will make us proud of our Nation in the council of nations , leadership in which the President of the United States , when he goes to the United Nations , as a man of dignity , standing for disarmament , standing for progress , standing for helping the unfortunate people of the world , and gaining respect rather than making a fool out of himself as did Mr. Khrushchev when he was there at the United Nations - and I know that everybody in this audience , everybody listening to me on television and radio , recognizes that the problems are difficult , difficult not because of our choosing , difficult not because of the other peace-loving nations - and , fortunately , my friends , they are most of the nations in this world , our allies in Europe and in Asia , the so-called neutrals in Africa , and in South America , and in other countries . Certainly in this period we realize that the problems are difficult only because there is on the loose in the world a great aggressive force , a force which is fanatical which is ruthless , whose leaders do not follow the rules of international diplomacy , as we would like them to be followed , whose leaders - and I know them , and I speak from knowledge - are men who have one objective , and one only , and that is to conquer the world , conquer it without war , if they can , but willing to use any means , if that becomes necessary , and because when we have this kind of leadership , aggressive , always probing , always attempting to embarrass , always moving against us around the world , the period ahead is going to be a difficult one .

1650	disarmament	attack	I know that you must never make a concession to him without getting one in return . I know that you must never agree to disarmament , for example , unless you have an ironclad agreement from him that he 's going to do likewise . I know that that kind of firmness is what leads to peace .	A recent independent survey concluded : The only continuous features of our efforts in the disarmament field have been a lack of continuity in top personnel and a paucity of planning and research efforts . As a result of this failure we have been steadily unprepared on disarmament . Our delegates to international conferences have been inexperienced , understaffed , and inadequately instructed .

If he pursued the policies abroad which he has suggested - apology to Khrushchev , retreat in the Pacific , open interference in Cuba - could only pipe us into grave international crises , or worse . Take a specific field : Senator Kennedy 's campaign to talk us into a recession has now reached phase 2. If elected , he says , he will counsel with President Eisenhower about how to deal with it .	The Soviet Union has 10 times as many broadcasts in Spanish to Latin America as we do . We have no program , for example , to Cuba in radio or TV to tell the people of Cuba that we still are their friends , that we want them to be free . These are the things that we have to do to try to build a strong country here , to try to build a progressive and forward-looking country that 's meeting its problems , to try to find some way to distribute our food .

1652	medical care,health care	no_relation	Thomas Jefferson has often made the point that the greatest guarantee of freedom is to diffuse power and that we must not have concentration of power in an all-powerful Federal Government , and it is because we believe that any kind of program that would put immense power in the Federal Government over our school system is something that Americans should reject , not because of the amount of money that is being spent , but because this kind of power is something which , in the wrong hands , would be something that all Americans would be against . Let me give you one other example in the program of medical care for the aged . We all want better health care for our older citizens .	I consider that waste , too . There are many kinds of waste , and I think it is the function of government to use our resources to the fullest , to use our natural and material and human resources to the fullest , to educate our children , to build a stronger economy , to provide medical care for our aged under social security , to use to the fullest those areas of the United States where unemployment has been chronic for a great many years , to use our brains and our energy to build a stronger and better society here in the United States .

1653	unemployment	no_relation	Once again the economy surged to levels that they so like to cite . So what judgment is to be made of the opposition 's 20-year stewardship of the Nation 's economic affairs ? 1. Its policy was a tragic failure in solving the problem of unemployment during the peacetime years from 1933 to 1939 . 2. During the following 6 years , preparation for war and war itself solved the unemployment problem for them .	Unemployment is not inisignificant to the almost 4 million Americans who want to work , but who ca n't find work - almost a quarter of a million of them in Michigan alone - or to the almost 900,000 Americans who have been out of work for more than 15 weeks and who are now classified as  long-term unemployed .  Unemployment is not insignificant to the families of the unemployed - families who are forced to live in substandard homes and are unable to maintain even a subsistence of living in the richest country on earth . Unemployment is not insignificant to the children of the unemployed who are deprived of decent clothing and a decent diet .	Nixon_October_19_1960	Kennedy_October_14_1960

If you do n't have the right kind of health care , the Federal Government will set up a program that will do it . And you do n't have to worry about it .	Although 15 million Americans are forced to live in substandard dwellings - the Republican Party has adopted policies which have slowed down private housing - and consistently blocked Democratic efforts to enact programs to clear our slums , renew our cities , and provide decent homes for Americans of low and moderate incomes . And finally , although 9 million Americans over the age of 65 receive incomes of less than $ 20 a week - and 3 million more receive incomes of less than $ 40 a week - amounts on which they can not afford their higher medical bills - the Republican Party , only 2 weeks ago , blocked our efforts to provide medical care for the aged under social security . Some people say that this last brief session of the Congress was a handicap to the Democratic Party - and it is true that the Republicans blocked our efforts on every major front .

Mr. Nixon and the Republicans have stood against the progress since time began , and I believe in 1960 , in Michigan , which knows the significance of this election , I believe in Michigan and the United States , they are not going to entrust leadership to a candidate and a party that looks to the past .	The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve . In 1960 , this administration sought to extend minimum wage coverage to 3.1 million additional workers and indicated support of an increase in the minimum wage to $ 1.15 per hour . The misstatement : In the first debate Senator Kennedy said that the Republican Party gives only  lipservice  to programs of medical care for the aged .	Kennedy_October_26_1960	Nixon_October_19_1960
1657	disarmament	support	As President Eisenhower has said , the United States wants disarmament . We are willing to make all kinds of proposals for disarmament , but we are never going to disarm unless we are sure that the Soviet Union is also disarming at the same time through inspection , because if we did we would not be serving the cause of disarmament or of peace . We would be limiting our power at a time that the only one that threatens the peace of the world would be maintaining an advantage and gaining one that he did not previously have .	No home was safe and there was no freedom of religious worship . Mr. Khrushchev is in our country now , as he was a year ago , confident that all is going his way , smug in his recent successes , and piously talking about peace , colonialism , and disarmament . But how can you talk of peace , Mr. Khrushchev , when you and your Chinese Communist friends are undermining the peace every day , creating disorder and danger wherever you move ? How can you talk of colonialism when you are surrounded by your puppet dictators and when you hold in an iron grip a great empire stretching from East Berlin to Vietnam ? How can you talk of the achievements of your system , even if you beat us again by putting a man into outer space ? For we know that while you may bring a man back from outer space , you rarely bring one back alive from Siberia .	Nixon_September_21_1960	Kennedy_September_20_1960
1659	cuba	no_relation	The Associated Press this month featured an excellent survey by Relman Morin entitled  U.S. Prestige Is Damaged in Asia  - citing our image in that continent as that of a  well-meaning but confused and confusing giant .  To the Asian , this report said , the administration 's policy on Cuba  was a clear case of American indecision , fumbling , and possible weakness .  The events of last summer , the survey reported - the U-2 , summit , and Toyko chain of events -  appear to have shown that the United States was weak , indecisive , incapable of evaluating trends , anticipating developments and formulating action to meet them .	You have this choice as against our opponent who has not had this experience . In this campaign he has indicated by what he has said with regard to Quemoy and Matsu , with regard to his suggestion that the President could have apologized to Khrushchev for the U-2 flight , with regard to the latest boner that he has pulled , that on our policy on Cuba , if he had been President at those times , we could have made mistakes that would have been had for America , that could have led us right into the very disaster that we 've been trying to avoid . My friends , we can not take a chance in this critical year on untried inexperienced leadership in the White House of the United States , particularly when the man who asks for that opportunity is one who has  shot from the hip ,  one who , when the chips were down - and in this campaign he had to make up his mind - he made up his mind in the wrong direction .

1660	cuba	no_relation	Mr. Nixon chose to devote his speech here to Cuba . If there would be one topic that I would be reluctant to discuss if I were Republican , it would be Cuba . [ Applause .	The Paris Conference and the U-2 flights , he would have acted another way , different from the President . And then on Cuba he acted another way , or would have acted another way . Three times he 's been up .	Kennedy_October_28_1960	Nixon_October_25_1960
1661	unemployment	attack	To provide these jobs , our economy must grow much more rapidly - for today under Republican policies which stop growth we are growing more slowly than every other industrial nation . And it is significant that our prestige all over the world has been declining at the same time that the American economy has been almost stagnant with industries operating at half capacity and unemployment going up and up . Now , how can Government policy help create the jobs we need and provide full employment ? First , we must reverse the tight-money and high-interest-rate policies which have choked off investment and kept the small businessman and farmer from getting the capital they need to survive and expand .	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .	Kennedy_September_15_1960	Nixon_August_13_1960
1662	medical care,health care	no_relation	Why is it that everybody is so tremendously interested in this problem ? Oh , I 'm sure you know , just as I do and all of these great audiences to whom I have talked . They know that we can have the best farm income that we can possibly think of ; we can have the best jobs , the best schools , the best medical care , a splendid social security program , better than any of us have ever dreamed of , and all of these things at home wo n't mean anything at all unless we 're not around to enjoy them . So , therefore , people are concerned about foreign policy .	The point is that we pay for that . Every time the President vetoes a housing bill , every time a Republican Member votes against the $ 1.25 minimum wage , every time we are unable to get any support on our bill to tie medical care for the aged to social security , it is not the Congress that suffers , it is not the administration ; it is the people of the United States who require , in my opinion , a progressive , forward-looking government if this country is going to move forward . It is no accident that 400,000 people in a rich State like Pennsylvania wait every month for surplus food packages from the Federal Government .	Nixon_September_16_1960	Kennedy_September_16_1960
1664	minimum wage	attack	In the case of the minimum wage , we passed out of the Senate by a vote of nearly 2 to 1. That was the $ 1.25 minimum wage . Earlier , the House of Representatives passed a bill by , I think , nine votes against the $ 1.25 minimum wage , in favor of a wholly inadequate coverage under minimum wage which affected only about 1 million people . Nine more votes or a shift of five votes would have given us $ 1.25 in the House , and we would have then passed a bill for $ 1.25 and the President would have vetoed it , and we would not have been able to secure sufficient votes to override his veto .	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage .

1665	medical care,health care	no_relation	Now , if I can turn to one other issue , and the last one and the most important one of all . Again , what could be more important , some might ask , than jobs , housing , medical care , schools . And , of course , what could be more important is to be around to enjoy all the good things we have in this country .	[ Applause . ] And I could not leave here today , this great source of national strength here in Warm Springs , without reminding all of us that there is still unfinished business before us in the health field , that there are still over 18 million Americans over the age of 65 who live out their lives without assistance , without a recognition of the great problems that they face in the field of health , and I believe it incumbent upon the next Congress and the next administration to permit them to participate in the development of a trust fund which will provide protection in their old age without their having to take , as they now take , a pauper 's oath before they can receive medical assistance and medical care . [ Applause .	Nixon_October_11_1960	Kennedy_October_10_1960
1666	cuba	no_relation	However , people may say ,  But , Mr. Kennedy changes his mind . He does n't say the same thing on Cuba now . He says he supports the President in these other two areas now .	[ Applause . ] But I would also like to hear him discuss not just Cuba , but also the United States , Pennsylvania , how we are going to build a strong society here in the United States . I do n't worry about the cause of freedom , I do n't worry about our prestige around the world , our influence around the globe , as long as we are moving here at home .

1667	unemployment	no_relation	That was the Truman recession of 1949 . Unemployment jumped to almost 5 million . What saved the opposition this time from a dragging economy ? The Korean war .	[ Applause . ] These problems of housing and social security , unemployment compensation , minimum wages , and the others fall into the general category of proposals put forward either in the administration of President Wilson or President Roosevelt , or President Truman . In that field , though in some ways it is a new problem , but an old one , I would include education because this country has been aiding education since the country began , since the Northwest Ordinance set aside one-sixteenth of the territory in order to help education , back when this country was founded , to the land grant colleges in 1862 , to the vocational aids , to the aids to impacted districts .

1668	unemployment	attack	He knows it , the economy is moving up . He knows that unemployment went down more than seasonally last month and employment went up more than seasonally , and you know a funny thing ? In that same Detroit paper that I saw was an eight-column head  Kennedy Predicts Recession .  You know what an eight-column head right underneath it was ?  Auto Sales at an Alltime High in America .	And this was only the latest in a series of record increases stretching over the past 8 years . Yet at the same time , average weekly earnings took another drop as they have in every month since May. Unemployment rose to 5.7 percent of the labor force , higher than it was in the recession year of 1954 . The number of men and women forced to work part time steadily increased .	Nixon_October_28_1960	Kennedy_October_27_1960
1669	minimum wage	no_relation	It is not only medical care for the aged . It is minimum wage , it is housing for the elderly , public housing . It is all under social security .	You have the Kennedy bill , which would raise the minimum wage on a graduated basis to a dollar and a quarter in 3 years , and which would expand coverage to 5 million people not presently covered . You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase . It takes coverage away from some .	Kennedy_September_14_1960	Nixon_August_13_1960
1670	disarmament	support	But the hard facts of the matter are that we have fewer than 100 people in the entire Federal Government working on these problems . And the result has been that this country has not been prepared for any disarmament , arms control or atomic testing conference that has taken place since the end of the Korean war . I have proposed in the Congress the establishment of a National Peace Agency - an Arms Control Research Institute - and the next President of the United States must take this step to pave the way for peace .	But at the present time there is still a chance that the negotiations can result in an agreement in which testing will be discontinued by both the Soviet Union and the United States , or at least not resumed by both , assuming both have discontinued them , and that this agreement will have with it inspection procedures . Now the reason that it is vitally important that we continue to press forward until there is obviously no chance of success is that if we can get an agreement on nuclear testing , suspension of nuclear testing , with inspection , it opens the door and paves the way for disarmament with inspection . And this must be the goal of the President of the United States , whatever party he may be from .	Kennedy_September_9_1960	Nixon_August_13_1960
1673	minimum wage	attack	My opponent wants to win . Why do n't I say ,  Let 's have a dollar and a half ?  Why not a $ 2 minimum wage ? Why not $ 5 ? And here you get the basic economic principles . If you raise the minimum wage , in my opinion - and all the experts confirm this that I have talked to in the Government - above $ 1.15 , it would mean unemployment ; unemployment , because there are many industries that could not pay more than $ 1.15 without cutting down their work force ; $ 1.15 can be absorbed , and then at a later time we could move to $ 1.25 as the economy moves up .	The fact of the matter is that Mr. Nixon leads a party which has opposed progress for 25 years , and he is a representative of it . He leads a party which in 1935 voted 90 percent against a 25-cent minimum wage , and he leads a party which voted 90 percent in 1960 against $ 1.25 an hour minimum wage . [ Response from the audience .	Nixon_November_7_1960	Kennedy_November_6_1960
1674	medical care,health care	no_relation	Senator Kennedy added : The aged of this Nation deserve to spend their retirement years with proper recognition and respect for the contributions they have made to the American economy . They should have an income adequate to permit them to continue their important contributions to American life and a program of medical insurance through the social security system for dignified health care . I am proud of the endorsement of these outstanding scientists and practitioners in the field of aging .	I spelled it out to give you an example of an approach . I could give examples in medical care , in housing , in all the other fields . But I could only summarize by saying this .	Kennedy_October_12_1960	Nixon_October_11_1960
1676	minimum wage	support	[ Applause . ] The Republican Party , which in 1935 voted almost unanimously against the 25-cent minimum wage , voted almost unanimously against the $ 1.25 in 1960 . A Republican Party , which in 1935 voted 95 to 1 in the House of Representatives against the social security bill , voted 44 to 1 , with only one Republican , for medical care for the aged in the last session of the Congress .	They talked . But what did they produce ? They promised a 25-percent minimum wage increase in place of the program that President Eisenhower asked for and that could have been passed and should have been passed . What did the workers get ? Nothing at all .	Kennedy_October_3_1960	Nixon_September_29_1960
1677	unemployment	attack	if we want jobs , the way is through peace , with peace , and without inflation . And also my opponent knows this : He knows the unemployment figure dropped last month and , you know , a funny thing , that same Detroit paper that carried that story had another eight column headline right below it . You know what it said ?  Car Sales at Alltime High .	When the economy is not growing , few businesses are looking for new sites in which to locate plants . And when 159 areas of substantial unemployment are competing for the few new plants that are being built , no single area like Scranton can do much on its own . And , what is worse , most economists now agree that another recession is underway .	Nixon_October_28_1960	Kennedy_October_28_1960
1678	minimum wage	attack	In short , the high cost of living hurts almost every American . But its hurts most of all those whom the Republican brand of prosperity has left far behind - the 4 million unemployed , whose jobless insurance check is too low to meet these costs - the 3 million put on a short work week because our growth has slowed down and our major industries ( such as steel and coal and textiles and autos ) are below capacity - the millions earning the bare minimum wage , $ 1 an hour , $ 40 a week - which can not possibly be enough at today 's prices - the millions on an inadequate social security check - the schoolteachers in need of Federal aid - millions of Americans caught in a squeeze of costs rising faster than income - millions of Americans asking for help . Finally , last year , the Republicans decided to do something bold .	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .	Kennedy_September_25_1960	Nixon_August_13_1960
1679	disarmament	support	And I say that we can not and should not blame ourselves , our policies , our negotiators , their scientific advisers , or their instructions , for the unyielding refusal of the Soviets to make an agreement at Geneva . The time and patience which we have already expended to explore this way out of the disarmament dilemma have been full proof of our own intentions and those of the Soviets . The blame rests squarely on them .	For the hopes of all mankind rest on successful disarmament . And if we let the nations of Africa and Asia and Latin America feel that the United States is the real obstacle to disarmament , that we are not sincere in our desire for peace - if we continue to let the Soviet Union seize the offensive in disarmament negotiations - then these emerging areas of the world may well turn away from America and the free world , and begin to look to the Communist bloc for leadership in the fight for peace . And , of course , we must also seek disarmament because the only alternative to pursuit of an effective disarmament agreement is the pursuit of our present course - the arms race , the gap , new weapons , the development of even higher orders of mutual terror resulting in the ever higher likelihood of mutual destruction .	Nixon_October_26_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
1681	disarmament	no_relation	Whenever that balance changes , whenever the Soviet Union gains strength as against our strength , war 's danger increases , because they are wanting to use their strength not as we are , for peace , but to conquer the world . So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war . That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests .	This administration , a year ago , in order to get a position on disarmament , appointed a lawyer from my own State of Massachusetts , Mr. Coolidge , who had had no previous experience in the field . After 3 months , his report was dismissed and so was he , and a New York lawyer , after 5 weeks of preparation , was sent to head up our mission to the Disarmament Conference . One hundred people working on one of the most important , involved , specialized fields the subject of disarmament , nuclear control .	Nixon_October_27_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
1684	unemployment	no_relation	There are 15 million American homes in the United States which are sub-standard . The average unemployment compensation check in the United States , the richest country on earth , is $ 31 a week , and in some States as little as 8 weeks . The average wage for laundrywomen in five large cities of the United States , and most of them are Negro women , is 65 cents an hour for a 48-hour week .	I will tell you today the things that I believe are necessary , the program that I stand for . I will tell you , for example , that I think we need economic policies that will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million people , that will increase employment , that we need Government policies , for example , which will provide better guarantees and better protection against unemployment than we presently have . I will tell you today , for example , that I think those policies will produce more economic programs and progress than will the policies of our opponents .

1685	unemployment	no_relation	Once again the economy surged to levels that they so like to cite . So what judgment is to be made of the opposition 's 20-year stewardship of the Nation 's economic affairs ? 1. Its policy was a tragic failure in solving the problem of unemployment during the peacetime years from 1933 to 1939 . 2. During the following 6 years , preparation for war and war itself solved the unemployment problem for them .	Pennsylvania relies on two industries basically : coal mining and steelmaking . Both of these industries have experienced automation , and it is the reason that there is unemployment of 9 percent in this general area of these counties in western Pennsylvania , 9 percent . You have not really recovered in a very real way in the State of Pennsylvania from the recession of 1958 .	Nixon_October_19_1960	Kennedy_October_15_1960
1686	disarmament	no_relation	Today , 100 years later , I come from my native city of Boston to Wisconsin , to tell you that Carl Schurz 's teachings have not been forgotten . That I know , and all Americans realize , that peace and disarmament are remote and difficult goals . But we have chosen them as ideals to guide our actions .	I see him , ruthless , tough , completely a man dedicated to one purpose only - the evil purpose of conquering the world , and this is what I know . If America ever makes the mistake of entering into a disarmament agreement , which he does not also keep with inspection , it will increase the danger of war rather than reduce it , and I 'll tell you why : We can not leave to a man who is the enemy of peace power to start a war and destroy the world . We have to have the power because we are friends of peace .	Kennedy_October_23_1960	Nixon_October_22_1960
1687	unemployment	no_relation	To strengthen our country from within , he promises to move the Federal Government into the very heart of your school system by providing Federal dollars for use to pay the salaries of your teachers , which would inevitably bring Federal control of what is taught . To assure a vital economy , he promises a minimum wage that official studies show would force unemployment and business failures . To protect the unfortunate , he promises to give the wealthiest people in American a helping hand with medical costs in their later years , while withholding help from some 3 million people with incomes of $ 2,000 or less ; in fact , in the name of freedom he would force this medical program on one and all , save the 3 million who need help the most .	If the people 's interest is going to be protected , the President of the United States must stand for that protection . It is the President of the United States that can set the goals for the country in housing , minimum wage , social security , unemployment compensation , and in equality of rights for all Americans , regardless of their race or color . I stand in direct succession to Truman and Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson , who advanced the right of all Americans to participate equally in our society .	Nixon_October_3_1960	Kennedy_October_3_1960
1688	medical care,health care	support	But I think - I think , in this case , experience does count . I believe in an America where one 's latest years are the good years - years of security and dignity ; where medical care for the aged is provided out of social security - a contribution of less than 3 cents a day during their working years ; where older people can find decent housing , suitable to their needs ; and where doors are not automatically shut in their face by any employer , including the Federal Government , for in those crucial years we need their wisdom and their counsel . I talked recently to a grandmother in Dayton , Ohio , who could not bear to ask her children , with whom she was then living , for the $ 13 a week she needed for medicine , because they were giving so much up to sustain her at that time .	A further Federal - State program should be inaugurated at once , designed to help rehabilitate handicapped persons who may never again be able to accept regular employment but who can be brought to the point where they need not be dependent on custodial care . Many older people in hospitals and nursing homes today could care for themselves in the proper setting , if the combined forces of medical care , social service counseling , and other resources were brought to bear on their handicaps . Additional Federal funds should be made available for research and training in the field of rehabilitation , with special emphasis on rehabilitation of older people .	Kennedy_October_31_1960	Nixon_October_30_1960

On all the great issues which disturb our country , minimum wage , social security , unemployment compensation , houses , roads , schools , hospitals , our parties have divided and we have divided , and the great questions for the 1960 's are how is it going to be possible to move this country forward , build its economy , provide employment for its people . And there are 4 ½ million of them out of work today .	We 'll see that we move ahead in science . We will see to it that we have social security and unemployment insurance , that we will extend all of these things that are good for America and that Americans need , but I say to you also , as President , that there will be certainly not one dollar spent that does n't need to be spent . And here you 've got a choice .	Kennedy_October_24_1960	Nixon_October_22_1960
1692	minimum wage	attack	The principles for which Dwight Eisenhower and I have fought and will continue to fight are the ideals not only of Republicans but of Democrats as well . All through the campaign my opponent has been trumpeting the falsehood that I , in effect , feast on human misery - that I oppose minimum wage , help to distressed areas , social security , medical care for the aged , and all else that concerns the good of the American people . Last week Mr. Kennedy called me the leader of the social security wrecking crew - trying to secure votes from the aged by playing on their fears .	[ Applause . ] In the debate 2 or 3 weeks ago , Mr. Nixon stated that he thought $ 1.25 minimum wage was extreme . Do you know what the average wage for laundrywomen , and most of them are Negroes , in five large cities of the United States is ? Sixty-five cents an hour for a 48-hour week .

1693	cuba	no_relation	He shot from the hip and said , the President could have apologized , could have expressed regrets . Was he right ? Was the President right ? And the third point , on Cuba . Here again - and here 's where belligerency comes in - the President said we 're going to quarantine this little pipsqueak Castro , and we quarantined him by putting in effect economic restrictions on our trade .	 He tells us now that economic aid to Cuba and Latin America 5 years ago would have prevented the rise of Castro - but he neglects to say that he was there 5 years ago and did n't do anything about it . He tells us now that his trips abroad were a valuable experience - but the facts are that every key area he has visited is less friendly to western views now than it was at the time of his visit : Ghana , Laos , Cuba , Panama , and at least 10 others . The great tragedy of American foreign policy in all of these areas was our failure to recognize the situation before the crisis developed .	Nixon_November_3_1960	Kennedy_November_3_1960
1694	cuba	attack	I say in that connection that with all the criticism of President Eisenhower 's administration , they ca n't take away the solid fact that under his leadership we got the United States out of one war ; we 've kept her out of other wars , and we do have peace without surrender today . Yes , there are problems , problems like the one in Cuba that my opponent is discussing tonight without offering any solution for , and , incidentally , may I say , looking at that problem , I will have more to say about that at a later time , and he had better look to the record of his administration before he starts criticizing ours in that field . He talks about dictators , and I can only say that the number of dictators we inherited from the Truman administration is far greater than the number we have today in Latin America , and that 's something he must remember .	Cuba is not the only example . What I am concerned about is in 1970 I do n't want to see independent country after independent country begin to move where Guinea and Ghana have gone , where the Congo almost went and may still go , where Cuba has already gone , because for a simple reason they feel that the Communists represent the future , they feel that we are identified with the past , they feel that we are identified with colonialism , they feel that we are identified with the kind of future which they do not want . Why ? After all , what we want is their independence .	Nixon_October_6_1960	Kennedy_October_3_1960
1695	cuba	no_relation	I believe this matter is so fundamental to decency in world affairs that until Red China has proved her adherence to these standards by her deeds and not just by her words , the next President should consider a veto , which we have never used , to be fully justified by the United States in the National Security Council - a veto of any effort to admit a nation that does not comply , as Red China does not comply . And now I want to turn to one other subject at hand , much closer , the problem of Cuba , a very difficult problem . People have often said ,  Mr .	I approved of his trip . But who does Mr. Nixon think he fools in the last 3 weeks of an election , who does he think he fools when he says we will have no more debates after this week , as he goes around the country casting his innuendoes , suggesting that we in the Democratic Party are not as devoted to the cause of freedom , implying that for some reason or other we were misled by Khrushchev and he understood him all the time ? I was not the Vice President of the United States who presided over the communization of Cuba . [ Applause .	Nixon_October_18_1960	Kennedy_October_18_1960
1696	disarmament	attack	Halt the arms race .  Let me tell you about disarmament . When people say ,  I 'm for disarmament ,  and when some people write to me and say  Why , when Mr. Khrushchev comes over and says he 's for total disarmament - why do we have to insist on inspection ? Why ,  they say ,  could n't we just do it ? Would n't that be real leadership in the world ? Would n't that be bold and imaginative ?  Yes , it would ; but do you know what would happen ? The moment the United States ever enters into an agreement for disarmament , which would result in increasing his strength as against ours , we do n't help the cause of peace .	The struggle for disarmament will not be an easy one . For disarmament is an ideal just as peace itself is an ideal , but it was a great son of Wisconsin , Carl Schurz , who said : Ideals are like stars ; you will not succeed in touching them with your hands . But , like the seafaring man on the desert of waters , you choose them as your guides , and following them you will reach your destiny .	Nixon_October_25_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
1697	disarmament	no_relation	I know that you must never make a concession to him without getting one in return . I know that you must never agree to disarmament , for example , unless you have an ironclad agreement from him that he 's going to do likewise . I know that that kind of firmness is what leads to peace .	Only the President can overcome the frictions and differences between those agencies ; only he can weld all the parts of the Executive into a singleness of purpose in the pursuit of peace , and only the President can make the hard decisions , decisions involving peace or war , destruction or survival , which peace programs as well as war programs will surely bring . The struggle for disarmament will not be an easy one . For disarmament is an ideal just as peace itself is an ideal , but it was a great son of Wisconsin , Carl Schurz , who said : Ideals are like stars ; you will not succeed in touching them with your hands .

1699	disarmament	support	We will never be belligerent . We 're always going to be willing to go the extra mile to negotiate disarmament or anything , but we 're never going to fall into the fatal error of what has got us in war in the past and that is let dictators think that we will not react . So , this is the way to peace , and I want you to know that we will have no greater obligation than to keep the peace for ourselves , for our children , and also to see to it that our children have an opportunity to grow up and have a better life even than we 've had .	Perhaps the science of inspection will be unable to keep pace with advancing weapons technology . But no matter how difficult the problems are , how discouraging the obstacles , how uncertain the prospect for agreement , we must , nevertheless , begin a determined , large-scale effort to prepare ourselves for disarmament - to formulate constructive and realistic proposals which have a chance of success . For the hopes of all mankind rest on successful disarmament .	Nixon_October_28_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
1702	minimum wage	attack	The two can not be separated . The man who opposes a decent increase in the minimum wage is not likely to be more generous toward a badly underpaid schoolteacher . The man who opposes proper medical care for the aged has no more compassion for the small farmer or the small businessman or the hungry families in this Nation and around the world .	You have the Kennedy bill , which would raise the minimum wage on a graduated basis to a dollar and a quarter in 3 years , and which would expand coverage to 5 million people not presently covered . You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase . It takes coverage away from some .	Kennedy_September_5_1960	Nixon_August_13_1960
1703	minimum wage	no_relation	I think the August session of the Congress offered in my opinion a very clear example of how unfortunate it would be to have 4 more years of a divided government with neither party bearing responsibility and both parties sharing power . After passing in the U.S. Senate a bill providing for $ l.25 minimum wage , we failed in the conference to secure the passage of that bill . After passing in the Senate of the United States a bill for aid for education , and a bill for aid for housing , we failed to get both of those bills to the floor of the House of Representatives for a vote , and every Republican member of the Rules Committee of the House voted against them going to the floor of the House of Representatives .	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .

1704	disarmament	no_relation	This administration , a year ago , in order to get a position on disarmament , appointed a lawyer from my own State of Massachusetts , Mr. Coolidge , who had had no previous experience in the field .

One hundred people working on one of the most important , involved , specialized fields the subject of disarmament , nuclear control .	I see him , ruthless , tough , completely a man dedicated to one purpose only - the evil purpose of conquering the world , and this is what I know . If America ever makes the mistake of entering into a disarmament agreement , which he does not also keep with inspection , it will increase the danger of war rather than reduce it , and I 'll tell you why : We can not leave to a man who is the enemy of peace power to start a war and destroy the world .

I say that President Eisenhower gained prestige for America when with great dignity and great responsibility , he stood for peace , for disarmament , for all the things that Americans believe in. No , my friends , the real test of prestige , if our prestige was low , I can assure you , would occur in the United Nations , and there what do we find ? In every instance where we 've had a test vote - and listen to this - in the last 7 years , with the Soviet Union on one side and the United States on the other , we have won ; and in the vote on the Congo we won , 70 to nothing . My friends , that 's a pretty good score in football .	We have gone into every conference unprepared .

I am sure many of you who are listening tonight or viewing this program saw that debate , and you recall there that I and my opponent had a sharp disagreement .

Here in the West we want to develop our tremendous natural resources through reclamation projects .	In no area is progress more vitally needed than the area of health . The cost of medical care has skyrocketed beyond the reach of many citizens , particularly our older citizens - and yet the present administration requires them to take a  pauper 's oath  before they can receive assistance . There are too few doctors , too few nurses , and too few hospitals .	Nixon_October_11_1960	Kennedy_October_10_1960
1712	cuba	attack	But what I do suggest is that at least we have some concern , some recognition , some idea of the changing nature of our times . The whole problem in Cuba is not a dialogue about Mr. Castro . The whole problem in Cuba is what is going to happen in the rest of Latin America , whose side is going to be successful in those areas , which system offers the hope to these people .	A major portion of the blame , I say , will rest on Mr. Kennedy , who two weeks before an election has made a statement which not only is provocative , but will be interpreted by the Soviets as an express invitation to do exactly that . And if they do come in you know what the result is ? It can only mean a civil war in Cuba , which the United States would not avoid entering , and this result could easily be spread into a conflict , into a world war , that every American of both parties wants to avoid ; and I say that Senator Kennedy owes it to the Nation to put the cause of peace and freedom before political consideration and to retract this immature , rash , and dangerous suggestion that he has made . Now , some of you who heard the debate , though , will remember that he said :  But , after all , this is nothing new ,  that we helped , he said , the Castro forces get arms and ammunition in the United States when they were supporting their revolution against Batista .

1713	unemployment	attack	Once again the economy surged to levels that they so like to cite . So what judgment is to be made of the opposition 's 20-year stewardship of the Nation 's economic affairs ? 1. Its policy was a tragic failure in solving the problem of unemployment during the peacetime years from 1933 to 1939 . 2. During the following 6 years , preparation for war and war itself solved the unemployment problem for them .	However , there are other specific measures which can be adopted with discretion according to precise needs of the moment . ( a ) A balanced budget - except during times of emergency affecting the national security or a high rate of unemployment . ( b ) An insistence that collective bargaining takes public interest as well as private advantage into account .	Nixon_October_19_1960	Kennedy_October_18_1960

1715	minimum wage	attack	To strengthen our country from within , he promises to move the Federal Government into the very heart of your school system by providing Federal dollars for use to pay the salaries of your teachers , which would inevitably bring Federal control of what is taught . To assure a vital economy , he promises a minimum wage that official studies show would force unemployment and business failures . To protect the unfortunate , he promises to give the wealthiest people in American a helping hand with medical costs in their later years , while withholding help from some 3 million people with incomes of $ 2,000 or less ; in fact , in the name of freedom he would force this medical program on one and all , save the 3 million who need help the most .	But our goals are not the same . I want a $ 1.25 an hour minimum wage , medical care for the aged through social security , Federal aid to help raise teachers salaries as well as schools , an adequate program of slum clearance and low-rent housing , and a program of aid to areas of chronic unemployment which would include northern Minnesota .

Secondly , our intimate association in some countries with dictators at a time when a whole democratic movement was sweeping Latin America has led to some of our difficulties , not only Cuba , but in some other sections of that vital area . I am chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa .	Oh , the problems are great . In Cuba , in the Congo , in the Near East , all over the world , there are problems with which we are confronted and we will continue to be confronted with them in the years ahead .

We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage .

Yet in the past 8 years , and in my opinion this is one of the most serious indictments that can be leveled against this administration , in this vital area in the past 8 years this administration has given this problem no attention . In the entire U.S. Government we have had fewer than 100 people working on the complex subject of arms control and disarmament , less than 100 people , scattered through four or five agencies of the Government . When I reminded Mr. Nixon of this in one of the debates he gave one of his usual answers .	Nixon_October_28_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
1721	unemployment	no_relation	We come from all continents , from all countries , from all races and all religions and what better evidence of it than here ? I recall talking to Mr. Herbert Hoover at the time he was working with me on the Hungarian refugee problems , trying to develop programs for the refugees . Concern was expressed at that time about changing our immigration laws to allow more refugees to come in , concern with regard to the effect on employment and unemployment in this country , concern as to how these people could be assimilated . His answer was that every wave of refugees that has come to the United States has strengthened America rather than weakened it .	 But Mr. Nixon and the party he leads say they are content , just as they have always been content , in the face of poverty and unemployment and an America with its most urgent needs unmet . The Republican Party which Mr. Nixon leads today is the same Republican Party which for half a century has opposed every single progressive measure which the Democrats have designed to improve human welfare and reduce human misery - the party which fought against the New Deal and tried to block the Fair Deal - the party which , in the past 8 years , has vetoed aid to areas of unemployment , blocked efforts to improve unemployment compensation , opposed raising the minimum wage , refused to expand the distribution of surplus food to the hungry , and failed to offer one single program to increase the welfare of the American people . But Americans will not forget Mr. Nixon 's party this November - and they will return the Democrats to leadership so that all Americans can share in American abundance .

1722	disarmament	attack	But I know that there is not one person in the State or Nation who would not like to see the arms race ended - the threat of war recede - and the billions now spent on weapons of destruction turned to schools and hospitals and homes and dams . And with imaginative and painstaking planning for reconversion this State would enjoy a greater boom under disarmament than it ever enjoyed in the cold war . For peace is our deepest aspiration .	I have those who have written to me and said ,  Now , Mr. Nixon , you 're a Quaker , you believe in peace . Why is it that you stand against the proposals for disarmament that are made by Mr. Khrushchev ? Why is it that we ca n't go more than halfway on these proposals and take some of them on faith ?  I want to tell you why we ca n't . Because if the United States ever enters into a disarmament agreement with the Soviet or with any other potential aggressor which they might break and which we would keep , that would increase the danger of war rather than reduce it and that we must never do .	Kennedy_September_11_1960	Nixon_August_2_1960
1723	minimum wage	attack	I want to make it very clear that the differences between Mr. Nixon and myself , the differences between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party are clear . Mr. Nixon represents a party , a philosophy which he believes in , which voted against social security and minimum wage and housing and unemployment compensation . The fact of the matter is that the Republican Party controlled the Congress and the Presidency for years and no civil rights bill ever saw the light of day .	The Republican program in education , unlike Mr. Kennedy 's would provide funds for school construction which would enable State and local districts to use their money for raising teachers salaries , without involving the Government in the direct payment of teachers salaries which would lead toward dictation from Washington as to what is taught in our schools to our children . It is a matter of record that Republicans have extended social security and strengthened minimum wage legislation . Moreover , we care too much for people to advocate programs , as my opponent does , which would raise Federal spending by over $ 15 billion a year - programs so great they could be paid for , not out of miracles of economic growth , but by 180 million Americans in higher taxes and higher prices .	Kennedy_November_1_1960	Nixon_October_29_1960
1724	disarmament	attack	So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war . That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests . Yes , but we will never agree to an agreement unless the Soviet Union is going to require inspection as well as the United States .	We did not come up with a single major new proposal in the field of arms control , and we cared so little about it that we regarded the entire effort as merely a part of our effort in psychological warfare . At the London Conference of 1957 , the first important disarmament Conference held in the fifties , and the one which came closest of any in reaching an agreement on disarmament , we sent a man who had not been active in the field , Harold Stassen , we sent him to a meeting without formulating an American position . Mr. Stassen was never able to get clear instructions at the meeting as to what our position was .	Nixon_October_27_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
1725	cuba	no_relation	[ Applause . ] But I would also like to hear him discuss not just Cuba , but also the United States , Pennsylvania , how we are going to build a strong society here in the United States . I do n't worry about the cause of freedom , I do n't worry about our prestige around the world , our influence around the globe , as long as we are moving here at home .	Take my opponent , for example . He says on the Cuban situation that he did not intend to suggest that the American Government should intervene in the internal affairs of Cuba . And yet the words he used ,  the U.S. Government should support the anti-Castro forces in Cuba  have been interpreted by his friends among the press , by all the people abroad , by all of the allies of the United States , as meaning exactly that .	Kennedy_October_28_1960	Nixon_October_26_1960
1726	disarmament	attack	The hope for peace is to be firm against those who threaten the peace so that they ca n't blackmail us . The hope for peace is then to go out and sit down , from a position of strength , and negotiate for disarmament for peace but always from strength and never from weakness . And that 's what Cabot Lodge and I will do .	In short , no problem is more vital or more urgent in the struggle for peace than the problem of effective arms control . Yet , in the past 80 years , this problem has been virtually ignored ; we have had no real disarmament policy . And we have completely failed to provide the effort and the leadership which the pursuit of disarmament demands .	Nixon_October_28_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
1727	disarmament	support	There is no sense having a meeting unless there is an atmosphere before the meeting which leads you to hope that there will be some success . On the issues on which we are divided with the Soviet Union , disarmament and Berlin , which are the two chief ones at the present time , there is no indication that there is a common meeting ground . Therefore , just to meet , just to sit down , just to spend an hour , unless there is some basis for hope , particularly as Khrushchev is being extremely belligerent now , I thought the President showed good judgment .	We can be proud that we are working through the United Nations to maintain the freedom of these people rather than to take it away . It 's true that President Eisenhower is n't making a fool of himself on the floor of the U.N. It 's true that he is advocating a program for disarmament , for the use of outer space , a program in addition , for the use of our surpluses through the United Nations . All of these are honest , decent proposals , which the whole world applauds .	Kennedy_October_4_1960	Nixon_October_3_1960
1728	cuba	no_relation	[ Response from the audience ; applause . ] The fact of the matter is that in the last 8 years not a single Soviet soldier has crossed the frontiers of Russia or their present territory , and yet Cuba , Laos , in part Iraq , their influence in Ghana and Guinea , their influence in Latin America their influence in Africa , their influence in Asia , their influence at the United Nations , their military position , their scientific position , their production of scientists and engineers have all steadily increased in relation to ours , and the judgment that you must make as you sit here in Florida , 90 miles from Cuba , 8 minutes by jet - you have to determine whether you can support the leadership of a candidate and a party which runs on a slogan of  We 've Never Had It So Good .  I do n't run on that slogan .	They 're going to stir up trouble . We 're going to have trouble not only in Cuba but in Japan and all over the world . Why ? Because they 're going to stir them up .

And Roosevelt and Landon , and Truman and Dewey . Where did they get those candidates ?

1730	disarmament	attack	Let me just make this one point . We will always go the extra mile to negotiate , We will always make over every proposal and take every initiative , as President Eisenhower did , on disarmament , on open skies , on the use of outer space for peaceful purposes in his U.N. speech . But , on the other hand , if we really want peace , my friends , the way to destroy our hopes is for the United States ever to agree to disarm when the Russians are n't also doing it .	The negotiations on nuclear testing are as far apart as they ever were . The talks on disarmament have been called off . And , finally , instead of the hoped-for general relaxation of world tension , the Soviets have stepped up the tempo of disorder , division and danger .	Nixon_October_1_1960	Kennedy_September_29_1960
1732	unemployment	no_relation	One last point I would like to make as far as recession is concerned : I think we can do some other things that will smooth out the business cycle . One in particular is with regard to unemployment compensation . I think that unemployment compensation - our unemployment compensation principles and programs - should be revised , so that we can have a more effective method .	I represent a section of the United States , New England , which has had the same problem that upper New York has had , defense contracts leaving , industries laying off , and we have begun to bring them back , particularly in electronics and in the Raytheon Co. I think defense contracts should be fairly distributed across the Nation . I also support the reestablishment of the Defense Manpower Policy No.4, which was thrown out in 1952 , which provided that those defense contracts would go to those areas which were able to meet the competitive price and had over 8 percent unemployment . I think we can use defense contracts to strengthen the economy as well as strengthen the country .	Nixon_September_28_1960	Kennedy_September_28_1960

And , so I want to make clear where we do stand . I favor programs , programs that are constructive , programs that will work , programs that will produce progress ; more schools , a breakthrough in science , a breakthrough in medical care and medical research , progress in terms of better jobs for the American people , raising the minimum standards as far as our minimum wage , and our unemployment coverage is concerned . All of these things I stand for , but I want to make one thing clear : As far as the cost of my programs are concerned , they are billions less than what my opponent 's would cost .

1740	minimum wage	attack	The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve . In 1960 , this administration sought to extend minimum wage coverage to 3.1 million additional workers and indicated support of an increase in the minimum wage to $ 1.15 per hour . The misstatement : In the first debate Senator Kennedy said that the Republican Party gives only  lipservice  to programs of medical care for the aged .	It is the kind of problem that is difficult of solution , but it is the kind of problem that the Republicans never think about . They have never concerned themselves in the last 25 years with the problems of employment , of social security , of housing , of minimum wage , of social justice , of equality of treatment , of aid to education , of a stronger better America , to which we are committed . So I come here to Pennsylvania a State which has not gone Democratic in a presidential election for 20 years , and I come here and ask your belp in this campaign .

1742	medical care,health care	attack	But progressive legislation has not been the aim of the Republican leadership . Their aim has been : ( 1 ) To block the minimum wage bill ( which in its first year of operation would have raised the wages of an estimated 1 million Negro workers ) , the aged health care , housing , and education bills ( which also would have meant major advances in the rights of our lower income and minority group members ) . A majority of Republicans voted against the minimum wage bill , all but one voted against social security health care for the aged and not one Republican on the House Rules Committee was ready to let adequate education and housing bills come up for final action .	I believe that the most effective method is through a program which will provide a choice whereby people who want to have the protection for catastrophic illnesses or , for that matter , for noncatastrophic illnesses , if they so desire , can have it , but where they are not forced to have it if they do not desire , and where they can choose getting that protection through government or through private plans , which they might choose , with some government assistance . And I would agree with Senator Kennedy , incidentally , to this extent : he indicated that this would be an issue in the campaign , I think it will be an issue in the campaign , and the question will not be one of ends , because both of us believe that there should he protection for our older citizens for medical care . The question will be one of means .	Kennedy_September_1_1960	Nixon_August_24_1960
1743	minimum wage	no_relation	I think , as you are aware , you actually have three bills which are potentially before the Congress . You have the Kennedy bill , which would raise the minimum wage on a graduated basis to a dollar and a quarter in 3 years , and which would expand coverage to 5 million people not presently covered . You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase .	He made this motion to table at a time when we had unlimited time to consider the measure . These bills - housing , education , medical help , and minimum wage - are vitally important to millions of American - Negroes and whites because they affect all those Americans who are on the lower level of our economic ladder . I strongly support civil rights and I am wholeheartedly committed to the implementation of the platform , but to use civil rights at this time as a method of defeating other bills whose passage are also essential would have meant that the session would have ended in complete failure .

1745	unemployment	attack	One will never learn from my opponent that employment declined less than seasonally last month and that unemployment went down more than seasonally . Unemployment dropped not only as to number but also as a percentage of the labor force . His pessimistic talk today recalls to my mind the situation in 1953 when the Eisenhower administration assumed responsibility for the Nation 's affairs .	If our economy is moving upward , then people are working , but if we stand still , if we have an administration frozen in the ice of its own indifference , if we have an administration which is interested - Mr. Nixon spoke at White Sulphur , W. Va . , to a group of businessmen in May. He said ,  As long as unemployment is under 4.5 million , it is not  - and I quote him -  a significant issue in the minds of the people .  I think it is .

1746	cuba	no_relation	I believe this matter is so fundamental to decency in world affairs that until Red China has proved her adherence to these standards by her deeds and not just by her words , the next President should consider a veto , which we have never used , to be fully justified by the United States in the National Security Council - a veto of any effort to admit a nation that does not comply , as Red China does not comply . And now I want to turn to one other subject at hand , much closer , the problem of Cuba , a very difficult problem . People have often said ,  Mr .	National independence can not exist without political independence - and want and poverty and hunger are the conditions under which communism feasts and prospers . These are just some of the steps which we must take if we are to succeed in halting the steady advance of communism - an advance which is now on our very doorstep in Cuba .

For I believe that we must act to eliminate discrimination in employment if a growing America is to serve as a living example of freedom to all the world . Sixth , we must formulate special programs to those areas of our country which are suffering from severe economic distress and chronic unemployment . Today , the country has 126 areas of substantial labor surplus - areas like Bay City , Flint , and the Iron Range - areas of declining industry - where there is poverty and hunger - where men have been searching for work , but can not find work .

1748	medical care,health care	attack	But I can take no satisfaction in them . I can take no satisfaction in coming to this valley and seeing pottery mills , seeing steel mills working part time , seeing rivers that are polluted , seeing an administration which has twice vetoed the area redevelopment bill , which has vetoed a hill to clean our rivers , which has vetoed twice in the last 12 months a housing bill , which considers $ 1.25 minimum wage an extreme , which considers medical care for the aged as extreme , and I quote Mr. Nixon accurately . I stand tonight in this city of Salem , in the State of Ohio , where Franklin Roosevelt stood and Woodrow Wilson , and I come here tonight and ask your help in this campaign .	It is very easy to talk about all the programs you 're for , but when they had the opportunity , as they have had the opportunity during these past years , they were not able to move forward in these areas in which they have talked . Now , let 's look at some of these programs , and particularly one that will be of great interest to this audience here , the program of medical care for the aged . We stand for a program which recognizes this program , recognizes it because we know that all of our families in this country want to see to it that our older citizens not only are well cared for , but that they have the opportunity to get care particularly when illnesses of serious nature strike .

1749	unemployment	no_relation	We come from all continents , from all countries , from all races and all religions and what better evidence of it than here ? I recall talking to Mr. Herbert Hoover at the time he was working with me on the Hungarian refugee problems , trying to develop programs for the refugees . Concern was expressed at that time about changing our immigration laws to allow more refugees to come in , concern with regard to the effect on employment and unemployment in this country , concern as to how these people could be assimilated . His answer was that every wave of refugees that has come to the United States has strengthened America rather than weakened it .	Throughout the entire Nation men and women - almost 4 million of them - are looking for jobs . Economists tell us that an unemployment rate of 6 percent is the danger signal . When a community passes that point it is officially regarded as an area of  substantial labor surplus .	Nixon_September_19_1960	Kennedy_September_19_1960

The raising of the minimum wage and its extension to cover millions of unprotected American workers must be one of the first items on the agenda of the next administration .

The arms control research institute would coordinate and direct all these research efforts , carrying them on itself or farming them out to private firms and universities .

Senator John F. Kennedy , Democrat of Massachusetts , tonight expressed strong satisfaction with the minimum wage bill , voted by the Senate 62 to 34 . The minimum wage bill , as passed by the Senate today , will extend protection of the minimum wage and the overtime requirements to approximately 4 million additional employees and will also provide for an increase to $ 1.25 in the existing minimum wage .

1757	unemployment	no_relation	 Is it true ? And the answer is , Of course it is n't true . The answer is - and now I 'm going to give you my version - the answer is that America , is moving forward , that unemployment went down more than usual last month and employment went up to record heights . The answer is that America will continue to move forward , continue to move forward , that is , unless we have some of our politicians talk us into a recession - and we are n't going to allow that to happen .	[ Applause . ] Social security , unemployment compensation , housing legislation , care for the aged - all of these programs - civil rights - in 1953 and 1954 the Republican Party controlled the White House , the Senate and the House .

Disarmament is only one failure of the last 8 years . [ Applause .	I select it because I believe it is the most important issue not only of this campaign , but of our time , of our generation , of this country .

Certainly in this period we realize that the problems are difficult only because there is on the loose in the world a great aggressive force , a force which is fanatical which is ruthless , whose leaders do not follow the rules of international diplomacy , as we would like them to be followed , whose leaders - and I know them , and I speak from knowledge - are men who have one objective , and one only , and that is to conquer the world , conquer it without war , if they can , but willing to use any means , if that becomes necessary , and because when we have this kind of leadership , aggressive , always probing , always attempting to embarrass , always moving against us around the world , the period ahead is going to be a difficult one .

1764	unemployment	attack	They tell a story of the division between the Republicans and the Democrats on the great issues of benefit to our people .

We have come down on behalf of the people , and I therefore am proud , as the standard bearer for a party which in this century has produced Woodrow Wilson , Franklin Roosevelt , and Harry Truman - I am proud to come to this city tonight and ask your support .	They have all been tried before . They were tried first from 1932 up until about 1939 , when the war spending began to come in , and after 7 years of that kind of policy there were still nine and a half million people unemployed in America and it took a war to reduce the unemployment . They were tried again in peacetime during the Truman administration , the same kind of policies that they 're advocating today .	Kennedy_September_27_1960	Nixon_September_22_1960
1765	cuba	no_relation	But what I do suggest is that at least we have some concern , some recognition , some idea of the changing nature of our times . The whole problem in Cuba is not a dialogue about Mr. Castro . The whole problem in Cuba is what is going to happen in the rest of Latin America , whose side is going to be successful in those areas , which system offers the hope to these people .	I do n't know how many of you have ever been to Havana . My wife and I have been there several times , and each time we always marvel at the great friendship that the people of Havana , the Cuban people , have for the people of the United States , and yet what have we found there ? The people of Cuba , the most misgoverned people perhaps in the American Hemisphere , or one of the worst governed ; Batista , a dictator who came into power long before President Eisenhower came in , who was inherited by us from the previous administration , and as a result there were revolutionary forces that wanted to get rid of him , and Mr. Castro took over these revolutionary forces and a lot of well-intentioned people in the United States felt that Mr. Castro was the answer to Cuba 's problem . He would get rid of this dictator , Batista .	Kennedy_October_23_1960	Nixon_October_22_1960

And then the third instance , the instance of Cuba - here again shooting from the hip , but not in the Texas fashion , because he missed the mark completely [ cheers and applause ] shooting from the hip and , rather than following the President , who said we 'll handle this fellow , Castro , within our treaties by quarantining him economically and politically , he said : No; no. We 've got to go further than that . We 've got to break our treaties - and he did n't say that but that 's the way everything was interpreted .	 He tells us now that economic aid to Cuba and Latin America 5 years ago would have prevented the rise of Castro - but he neglects to say that he was there 5 years ago and did n't do anything about it . He tells us now that his trips abroad were a valuable experience - but the facts are that every key area he has visited is less friendly to western views now than it was at the time of his visit : Ghana , Laos , Cuba , Panama , and at least 10 others . The great tragedy of American foreign policy in all of these areas was our failure to recognize the situation before the crisis developed .	Nixon_November_3_1960	Kennedy_November_3_1960
1769	unemployment	no_relation	 This letter from this 12-year-old boy sums up the concern that I found all over the United States as we have traveled this country north , east , west , and south . This concern and the idea that this is the major of this campaign is held not only by Republicans but by Democrats and independents , and I find that as far as this particular issue is concerned , it transcends all the rest , because while people , of course , are interested in how government can provide the climate in which we can continue to have good jobs and high wages and how government can provide the necessary procedures through which we can have social security in times of unemployment and better schools and hospitals - while they are interested in these things , they know it does n't make any difference if we had all those things if we are not around to enjoy them . I say to you the biggest , major issue which we should talk about today above all others is this : Which of the two candidates for the Vice Presidency and the Presidency can best provide the leadership for America and the free world in these next 4 years which will keep the peace without surrender and which will extend the freedom throughout the world .	[ Applause . ] Fifth , we have to provide job retraining and also decent unemployment compensation standards on a Federal level for those who are thrown out of work . This is an issue which is just beginning , but it is the kind of all issue which I think the Democratic Party recognizes .	Nixon_September_15_1960	Kennedy_September_5_1960
1770	minimum wage	attack	To strengthen our country from within , he promises to move the Federal Government into the very heart of your school system by providing Federal dollars for use to pay the salaries of your teachers , which would inevitably bring Federal control of what is taught . To assure a vital economy , he promises a minimum wage that official studies show would force unemployment and business failures . To protect the unfortunate , he promises to give the wealthiest people in American a helping hand with medical costs in their later years , while withholding help from some 3 million people with incomes of $ 2,000 or less ; in fact , in the name of freedom he would force this medical program on one and all , save the 3 million who need help the most .	Anybody who says that there is nothing left for us to do has not read the paper , does n't know what is left for the United States to do in its unfinished business here at home . As long as this administration refuses to pass a minimum wage of $ 1.25 an hour , as long as this administration vetoes housing bills , as long as this administration refuses to pass legislation for medical care for our older citizens , as long as there is not equality of opportunity for all Americans regardless of their race or their religion , there is unfinished business for our generation .

1774	disarmament	no_relation	So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war . That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests . Yes , but we will never agree to an agreement unless the Soviet Union is going to require inspection as well as the United States .	He prepared a report .

So , this is the way to peace , and I want you to know that we will have no greater obligation than to keep the peace for ourselves , for our children , and also to see to it that our children have an opportunity to grow up and have a better life even than we 've had .	And the Soviet Union has consistently had the initiative in the eyes of the world . At a time when our relative military strength was much higher than it is today , from 1953-55 , there was not a single top person in the entire Government working full time on disarmament .

And so , Senator Kennedy would deny these 3 million senior citizens the opportunity of protecting themselves in advance against the risks of heavy medical bills .	[ Applause . ] Social security ? The Republicans voted 90 percent against social security in the mid-thirties and voted 99 percent against medical care for the aged tied to social security in 1960 .

Earlier , the House of Representatives passed a bill by , I think , nine votes against the $ 1.25 minimum wage , in favor of a wholly inadequate coverage under minimum wage which affected only about 1 million people . Nine more votes or a shift of five votes would have given us $ 1.25 in the House , and we would have then passed a bill for $ 1.25 and the President would have vetoed it , and we would not have been able to secure sufficient votes to override his veto .

That I know , and all Americans realize , that peace and disarmament are remote and difficult goals . But we have chosen them as ideals to guide our actions .	We know what peace demands . We will always go the extra mile to strengthen peace , the extra mile to work for disarmament , the extra mile to reduce tensions , but we will always remember that the man we are dealing with and his colleagues are ruthless , fanatical aggressors and that they do not follow the rules of the game that we would like them to follow , and that we must treat them the way they are , and this means that we must never make a concession without being sure that we 're getting one in return , that we must never agree , for example , to disarmament unless we can be sure that they , too , are disarming . Why is this necessary for peace ? Because , as I said at my last stop , we 've got to remember that as long as the United States maintains its present position of being stronger than anyone who threatens the peace of the world we can be the guardians of peace ; but the moment that somebody or some nation that does not want peace - in other words , that would use war as an instrument of conquest - is stronger than we are , or thinks they are , then peace is no longer safe .

1786	medical care,health care	no_relation	We can go back to the August session of this Congress when there were three bills , which I think tell very well what the issues are in this campaign . One was medical care for the aged tied to social security . Forty-four Democratic Senators supported it , only one Republican , and it is a fact that in the last 7 days the Governor of this State , a Republican , has attacked the program which was passed in this last session of the Congress , because it was not tied to social security .	He 's had some of the same problems that President Eisenhower has had , and he 's handled them with superb skill and superb dignity , and I congratulate him for it . For example , the very quick way that he went to work on asking the legislature to provide for West Virginia 's participation in the new program for medical care for the aged .

Specifically you state that  We must attempt to strengthen the non-Batista democratic anti-Castro forces in exile , and in Cuba itself who offer eventual hope of overthrowing Castro . Thus far these fighters for freedom have had virtually no support from our Government .	Secondly , how is it possible for the United States and the Soviet Union and France and Britain to come to a conclusion to cease nuclear testing with some worthwhile inspection system ? How is it possible for us , who initiated the first atomic advance - how is it possible for us to make a decisive breakthrough in this area ? Because of experiments now going on in Western Germany , it appears likely that almost 20 countries will have an atomic capacity by 1965 . China , Egypt , Cuba - all the rest of them , all possessing atomic weapons , all possessing a hydrogen capacity perhaps all possessing ballistic missiles , and the means of delivering them . When we realize that war has been the constant companion of mankind through the ages , we are about to move into a period of history when any country or combination of countries can destroy themselves , their adversaries , and perhaps the human race , all in the next 10 years .

1788	minimum wage	attack	The Republican program in education , unlike Mr. Kennedy 's would provide funds for school construction which would enable State and local districts to use their money for raising teachers salaries , without involving the Government in the direct payment of teachers salaries which would lead toward dictation from Washington as to what is taught in our schools to our children . It is a matter of record that Republicans have extended social security and strengthened minimum wage legislation . Moreover , we care too much for people to advocate programs , as my opponent does , which would raise Federal spending by over $ 15 billion a year - programs so great they could be paid for , not out of miracles of economic growth , but by 180 million Americans in higher taxes and higher prices .	Put your thumb down regardless of what you do . We are fighting a candidate , the Republican Party , that for 20 years has opposed what the people need , minimum wage , housing , unemployment compensation . The real issue is which party and which candidate can best strengthen the United States , can best serve the public interest .	Nixon_October_29_1960	Kennedy_October_20_1960

Nothing at all .	Sixth , we must revise our outmoded unemployment compensation laws to allow men to receive full benefit payments while they are engaged in retraining programs . Seventh and finally , we must restore full employment to our schedule of national priorities - striving - for a more rapid growth of the American economy - building purchasing power through better minimum wage and unemployment compensation laws - having faith in America 's capacity to eventually provide a productive job for every man who wants to work . This is our program - a program which can help transform the threat of automation into the promise of abundance - a program which will require leadership inspired by both compassion and courage - a program which will require from labor , management , and Government a willingness to accept new concepts , new burdens and new risks to meet the challenge of automation 's new frontier .

1791	medical care,health care	no_relation	( Response from the audience . ) Mr. Nixon considers medical care for the aged tied to social security to be , and I quote him accurately ,  too extreme .  There are 17 million Americans and there is not anyone here who does not have a part of his family or he , himself or she , herself , will be some day in the same position .	And , so , today I think the first test you must put to the presidential candidate is , Are their policies the ones that will move America forward ? Move her in what way ? So that the American economy will grow and prosper , get jobs , higher wages for our people ; so that our schools and our school system can improve in quality ; so that our teachers can be better paid ; so that our standards can be raised ; so that we will have adequate classrooms , better education . We want better health care . All of these things - health , education , housing , jobs - which spell progress , we want for America , and I tell you today that in these fields I stand for programs that I believe will produce the greatest progress that America has ever had , a program that will expand our economy and create more jobs - not Government jobs , but jobs in private industry , which people want ; programs which will build more schools and release funds so that we can raise the salaries of our teachers , as they should be raised ; programs in the field of medical care for the aged , for example , which will provide that every person over 65 who wants health insurance can get it ; that everyone who ought to have it is encouraged to get it , but that no one who does not want it is forced to get it against his will , because that is the American principle .

1793	disarmament	no_relation	They want to go Eisenhower 's way - and that 's our way , and that 's the way we 're going . Now , the last point that I make is one that I make particularly because I know of the great concern the people in these university communities have for the cause of disarmament . People have often spoken to me - my friends who are Quakers , as I am , have written to me - and they have said ,  Mr .	And , of course , we must also seek disarmament because the only alternative to pursuit of an effective disarmament agreement is the pursuit of our present course - the arms race , the gap , new weapons , the development of even higher orders of mutual terror resulting in the ever higher likelihood of mutual destruction . But we will not move toward disarmament and a secure peace , we will not be any closer to freedom from fear , if we simply follow Mr. Nixon 's plan for meetings , more conferences , more study groups and discussions . For peace takes more than words .	Nixon_October_27_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
1795	unemployment	no_relation	[ Applause . ] And we will enact a bill which has passed the U.S. Senate twice , which has been vetoed twice , which provides assistance to those who live in distressed areas , which will help send Government contracts , which will provide loans for businessmen , which will provide vocational retraining , which will provide supplemental unemployment compensation benefits , so that in these distressed areas where unemployment is 8 , 9 , and 10 percent , we can help these places move again . This is a national problem , not a problem for a county in West Virginia or a county in my own State of Massachusetts .	I know what it is in the little store in which I worked to see a child of an unemployed man come in and have to ask to put things on the bill , knowing that his dad or hers probably was n't going to get a job for a while . I know what continued unemployment can do , not only to the men , but worse , to the morale of the children . I know what it is for a family to attempt to meet the bills at the end of the month .	Kennedy_September_19_1960	Nixon_September_15_1960
1797	minimum wage	no_relation	I think for the last 8 years we have had a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference . As long as there are 15 million Americans living in substandard housing , as long as the average unemployment compensation check for workers thrown out of work in this country is $ 32 a week , as long as there are millions of Americans who do not even receive the inadequate $ 1 an hour minimum wage , as long as the average check for laundry women in five large cities of this country is 65 cents an hour for a 48-hour week , as long as there are 4 million families receiving a food surplus package from our Government every month , so long is there need for the Democratic Party . [ Applause .	I think , as you are aware , you actually have three bills which are potentially before the Congress . You have the Kennedy bill , which would raise the minimum wage on a graduated basis to a dollar and a quarter in 3 years , and which would expand coverage to 5 million people not presently covered . You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase .	Kennedy_September_19_1960	Nixon_August_13_1960
1798	medical care,health care	no_relation	And this is all going to come at a time when automation and machinery is taking the place of men and women . I believe that we have to educate our children , that we have to provide jobs for those who want to work , that we have to provide security for those who have retired , particularly for medical care , that we must build in this country a strong and vital society which serves as an inspiration and an example to all those who look to us with confidence and hope . I come to this community in the closing days of a long campaign .	I know what it means to meet a family budget . I remember , as far as medical care is concerned , the day and the year that my father died , in 1956 . We had lots of medical bills that year .	Kennedy_October_30_1960	Nixon_October_29_1960
1799	unemployment	no_relation	For 6 years in the 1930 's the opposition failed miserably to solve the problem of unemployment . In 1939 , when war came in Europe , unemployment in America , after 6 futile years of their trying to solve it , stood just under 9 ½ million . Let 's face it : It took war to solve the unemployment riddle for them .	There are a billion more people crowding our globe , and every American can hear the rumbling of a distant drum . The next President will have a budget 25 times as large as that of the candidates in Al Smith 's time , and he will face problems unprecedented in that time or in any time in our long history , automation and unemployment , farm surpluses and food shortages , a high cost of living in the midst of an economic slump , new nations , new leaders , the world is different across the street and on the other side of the moon . The white race is in the minority , the free-enterprise system is in the minority , and the majority are looking at us harder and longer than they ever looked before .

1800	unemployment	no_relation	I know that the American labor movement wants for America what I want for America : the elimination of poverty and unemployment , the reestablishment of America 's position of leadership in the world , the end of racial discrimination everywhere in our society . I know the American labor movement opposes what I oppose : complacency , unemployment , economic stagnation , and national insecurity . I believe in the things the labor movement believes in and fights for .	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .	Kennedy_August_30_1960	Nixon_August_13_1960
1801	unemployment	attack	A real  truth squad ,  for example , would find it necessary to ask Mr. Nixon such questions as these : 1. Why do you repeat the statement that real wages have gone up 15 percent during the present administration compared with only 2 percent in the previous one , when your own Department of Labor figures clearly establish that the increase between September 1945 ( the first postwar month ) and January 1953 was 18.3 percent while the increase between January 1953 and August 1960 has been 13.7 percent . 2. Why have you not personally admitted that you misquoted me when you said that in my Detroit speech on Labor Day I had said  What the American labor movement wants for America is what I want for America  when this statement did not appear in either my advance statement or in the speech as actually delivered ? 3. When you insist that Federal aid to teachers salaries means Federal control over education , are you aware of the fact that the present program for aid to federally impacted areas has been free of such control , and that the provision which you killed with your tie-breaking vote contained explicit language ruling out any Federal  direction , supervision , or control over the policy determinations , personnel , program of instruction , or the administration or operation of any school or school system  ? 4. How can you claim credit for the present administration for more new water project starts than any other time in our history , when the stated Republican position except in campaign election years has been a no-new-starts policy that the Democratic Congress has sought to overcome ? 5. How can you call the vetoed 1960 Democratic bill on depressed areas  straight pork barrel  when your own Secretary of Labor , just 24 hours before the veto was announced , called the bill  good enough so that any Senator or Congressman from a State with areas of chronic unemployment would have no alternative but vote for it  ? 6. Why do you take credit for the present levels of operations at the National Institutes of Health , when the Democratic Congress , ignoring threats of veto , raised the administration request from $ 400 million to $ 560 million for the present year - the sixth consecutive year that Democrats have raised administration requests ? 7. On October 5 , in Philadelphia , you talked about civil rights and said ,  My position and that of my running mate has been clear and straightforward . We have said the same thing in every section of the country .	One will never learn from my opponent that employment declined less than seasonally last month and that unemployment went down more than seasonally . Unemployment dropped not only as to number but also as a percentage of the labor force . His pessimistic talk today recalls to my mind the situation in 1953 when the Eisenhower administration assumed responsibility for the Nation 's affairs .	Kennedy_October_20_1960	Nixon_October_19_1960
1802	minimum wage	attack	In short , the high cost of living hurts almost every American . But its hurts most of all those whom the Republican brand of prosperity has left far behind - the 4 million unemployed , whose jobless insurance check is too low to meet these costs - the 3 million put on a short work week because our growth has slowed down and our major industries ( such as steel and coal and textiles and autos ) are below capacity - the millions earning the bare minimum wage , $ 1 an hour , $ 40 a week - which can not possibly be enough at today 's prices - the millions on an inadequate social security check - the schoolteachers in need of Federal aid - millions of Americans caught in a squeeze of costs rising faster than income - millions of Americans asking for help . Finally , last year , the Republicans decided to do something bold .	I think , as you are aware , you actually have three bills which are potentially before the Congress . You have the Kennedy bill , which would raise the minimum wage on a graduated basis to a dollar and a quarter in 3 years , and which would expand coverage to 5 million people not presently covered . You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase .	Kennedy_September_25_1960	Nixon_August_13_1960
1803	minimum wage	attack	The second bill that was up and which is an issue in this campaign was a bill to provide $ 1.25 minimum wage . Four-fifths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives , including the Congressman of this district , who is chairman of the congressional committee for all Republicans , voted against the $ 1.25 minimum wage for a 40-hour week , not for a business which is only ten , fifteen , or twenty-five thousand dollars a year , but for a business which makes more than $ 1 million a year , we wanted to pay them $ 1.25 by 1962 , not this year , but 1962 , and to pay those that were not covered by 1964 $ 1.25 , and four-fifths of the Republicans voted against it . I think these issues are important , not because the minimum wage is maybe the most important issue in the United States today , and not because medical care for the aged itself may be the most important issue , and not because aid to education itself may be the most important issue .	I think , as you are aware , you actually have three bills which are potentially before the Congress . You have the Kennedy bill , which would raise the minimum wage on a graduated basis to a dollar and a quarter in 3 years , and which would expand coverage to 5 million people not presently covered .

1804	medical care,health care	no_relation	These are the times that you can read and have the time to read that you will never have later , and you can get the opportunity to specialize much later . You can learn about political science by participating in political organizations , and I would say certainly a political science course under the very able people who instruct you in our colleges and universities is worth while , but particularly to those who want to enter public service , if I could leave just one note - Remember , that while the broad background in the humanities and history and literature would seem to be very remote from the problems of Ghana and Cuba , from the problems of what we do about health care and what we do about the filibuster , remember those are the courses that will give you the judgment and the depth that is needed to react properly and intelligently to these great issues when they come before you years later , if you happen to enter public life . The last point that I would make is this : I want everybody here to certainly feel the necessity for , as I put it , going into politics ; I do n't mean all of you should run for office .	Just 1 percent of our population over the age of 65 has an income of over $ 10,000 , just 1 percent . So Mr. Nixon uses that old argument to prevent 99 percent of the people over 65 who live on an average social security check of less than $ 78 a month from getting medical care after they have retired - frozen in the ice of its own indifference , Mr. Nixon is .

Why did the people of Ghana and the leadership decide , even though an independent country , even with a great tradition of being tied to the British , even though they had every prospect of maintaining a society tied to the West , why have they in the last 3 years since they have been independent suddenly begun to tie their policies closely to that of the Soviet Union ? It is not chaos . It is not a military seizure of power like Cuba . Yet , Mr. Herter said 3 weeks ago that Ghana is supporting the foreign policy of the Soviet Union .

1807	minimum wage	attack	But progressive legislation has not been the aim of the Republican leadership . Their aim has been : ( 1 ) To block the minimum wage bill ( which in its first year of operation would have raised the wages of an estimated 1 million Negro workers ) , the aged health care , housing , and education bills ( which also would have meant major advances in the rights of our lower income and minority group members ) . A majority of Republicans voted against the minimum wage bill , all but one voted against social security health care for the aged and not one Republican on the House Rules Committee was ready to let adequate education and housing bills come up for final action .

Now it is Cuba .	The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve . In 1960 , this administration sought to extend minimum wage coverage to 3.1 million additional workers and indicated support of an increase in the minimum wage to $ 1.15 per hour .

I am determined to undertake every sensible measure to that end , to lift to ever higher levels the number of jobs in America , to reduce unemployment further , and to utilize more fully our industrial capacity in steel and other lines To achieve that goal we must release fully the greatest creative force in human affairs - the spirit of individual enterprise in 180 million Americans . That effort calls for a many-sided program which I have been developing , and will continue to develop , in this campaign .	You can sum it up in five words : The Republicans have vetoed Pennsylvania . The Democratic Congress passed two area development bills to help create jobs in areas of heavy and persistent unemployment . All of western Pennsylvania , including this county , would have been eligible .	Nixon_October_19_1960	Kennedy_October_15_1960

And , so , I say peace without surrender , the extension of freedom , this is the great issue .	After passing in the Senate of the United States a bill for aid for education , and a bill for aid for housing , we failed to get both of those bills to the floor of the House of Representatives for a vote , and every Republican member of the Rules Committee of the House voted against them going to the floor of the House of Representatives . We failed to secure passage of a bill connected with the Forand bill , tying medical care for the aged to social security .

In the case of the $ 1.25 minimum wage , which was my bill , which we did pass in the Senate by a vote of 2 to 1 , we failed in the conference with the House , after Mr. Dirksen , the minority leader , announced that the President of the United States would veto any bill that had $ 1.25 minimum wage . There were two other bills that I thought of importance .	You have the Kennedy bill , which would raise the minimum wage on a graduated basis to a dollar and a quarter in 3 years , and which would expand coverage to 5 million people not presently covered .

I select it because I believe it is the most important issue not only of this campaign , but of our time , of our generation , of this country . I select it because I know that the people of this State as the people of the other 49 States of the Union , want leadership which will continue to do what President Eisenhower has done , and for which the American people will be forever grateful to him , leadership that will keep the peace , keep it without surrender , leadership that will extend freedom , extend it without war , leadership which will make us proud of our Nation in the council of nations , leadership in which the President of the United States , when he goes to the United Nations , as a man of dignity , standing for disarmament , standing for progress , standing for helping the unfortunate people of the world , and gaining respect rather than making a fool out of himself as did Mr. Khrushchev when he was there at the United Nations - and I know that everybody in this audience , everybody listening to me on television and radio , recognizes that the problems are difficult , difficult not because of our choosing , difficult not because of the other peace-loving nations - and , fortunately , my friends , they are most of the nations in this world , our allies in Europe and in Asia , the so-called neutrals in Africa , and in South America , and in other countries . Certainly in this period we realize that the problems are difficult only because there is on the loose in the world a great aggressive force , a force which is fanatical which is ruthless , whose leaders do not follow the rules of international diplomacy , as we would like them to be followed , whose leaders - and I know them , and I speak from knowledge - are men who have one objective , and one only , and that is to conquer the world , conquer it without war , if they can , but willing to use any means , if that becomes necessary , and because when we have this kind of leadership , aggressive , always probing , always attempting to embarrass , always moving against us around the world , the period ahead is going to be a difficult one .

Does Mr. Khrushchev gain prestige when in Hungary he shoots down thousands of Hungarian students and workers in the streets of Budapest ? And do we lose prestige when in Cuba , where we have all the power in the world , we do not use the power , but we work through an Organization of American States to attempt to bring that country back into the paths of freedom ? Does he gain and we lose ? Of course not . Does he gain prestige when he breaks up a conference like the Paris Conference , when he blocks the road to peace ? Do we lose when President Eisenhower goes the extra mile and talks for it ? Of course not .

In other words , disarmament without inspection increases the risk of war .	Well , it is , Jackie , of course , the great problem .

We have not done so . Cuba is only a phase of a great struggle which will take place in the next decade . We talk about Mr. Castro .	Nixon_October_24_1960	Kennedy_October_24_1960
1822	minimum wage	attack	This summer , when we tried to improve the standards of social security by providing medical care for the aged tied to social security , again the great majority of the Republicans , over 90 percent , voted against medical care for the aged tied to social security . Eighty percent of the members of the House of Representatives who are Republicans voted against the $ 1.25 minimum wage , $ 50 a week for a 40-hour week for an industry , a business , that makes more than a million dollars a year . How can anybody live on it ? No Member of the Congress could .	The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve . In 1960 , this administration sought to extend minimum wage coverage to 3.1 million additional workers and indicated support of an increase in the minimum wage to $ 1.15 per hour . The misstatement : In the first debate Senator Kennedy said that the Republican Party gives only  lipservice  to programs of medical care for the aged .	Kennedy_October_21_1960	Nixon_October_19_1960
1823	unemployment	no_relation	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .	But the burden which should concern us most lies upon the American conscience . We can no longer tolerate growing patches of poverty and injustice in America - substandard wages , unemployment , city slums , inadequate medical care , inferior education and the sad plight of migratory workers . The enactment of this bill is only one step , but an essential step forward , as we cross this frontier to grasp the high opportunities which face the Nation .	Nixon_August_13_1960	Kennedy_August_10_1960
1824	minimum wage	attack	Meanwhile , the contradictory statements of Senator Kennedy still leave him opposed to this position . The misstatement : In the second debate Senator Kennedy said : The Republicans in recent years , not only in the last 25 years , but in the last 8 years , have opposed * * * minimum wage * * The facts : Senator Kennedy is saying that Republicans who opposed his particular bill are against minimum wage . The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve .	It is our responsibility to bring those programs , extension of the right to vote , civil rights , minimum wage , housing , education , to increase the opportunity for all Americans to share in the abundance . And I do not share the view of the Vice President that these programs are extreme ; $ 1.25 minimum wage , not this year , not until 1962 , for those people already covered , not until 1964 for the newly covered , and still that bill was voted against by 75 to 80 percent of the Members of the House of Representatives who are Republicans . Now , I believe the issue is quite clear in this field of social legislation .	Nixon_October_19_1960	Kennedy_October_19_1960
1825	medical care,health care	no_relation	I believe that the most effective method is through a program which will provide a choice whereby people who want to have the protection for catastrophic illnesses or , for that matter , for noncatastrophic illnesses , if they so desire , can have it , but where they are not forced to have it if they do not desire , and where they can choose getting that protection through government or through private plans , which they might choose , with some government assistance . And I would agree with Senator Kennedy , incidentally , to this extent : he indicated that this would be an issue in the campaign , I think it will be an issue in the campaign , and the question will not be one of ends , because both of us believe that there should he protection for our older citizens for medical care . The question will be one of means .	It does not depend upon the uncertainties of financing from general revenues . I feel strongly that there must be no means test in providing medical care insurance . Already 2 1/4 million of our older citizens must rely on public assistance for their daily needs .

1826	cuba	no_relation	Secondly , how is it possible for the United States and the Soviet Union and France and Britain to come to a conclusion to cease nuclear testing with some worthwhile inspection system ? How is it possible for us , who initiated the first atomic advance - how is it possible for us to make a decisive breakthrough in this area ? Because of experiments now going on in Western Germany , it appears likely that almost 20 countries will have an atomic capacity by 1965 . China , Egypt , Cuba - all the rest of them , all possessing atomic weapons , all possessing a hydrogen capacity perhaps all possessing ballistic missiles , and the means of delivering them . When we realize that war has been the constant companion of mankind through the ages , we are about to move into a period of history when any country or combination of countries can destroy themselves , their adversaries , and perhaps the human race , all in the next 10 years .	And , so , what does he suggest ? He comes up , as I pointed up , with the fantastic recommendation that the U.S. Government shall directly aid the anti-Castro forces both in and out of Cuba . Now , every freedom-loving person in the United States - let 's make it clear - is in sympathy with the democratic anti-Castro forces in Cuba and outside Cuba . We want them to win .

Its policy was a tragic failure in solving the problem of unemployment during the peacetime years from 1933 to 1939 . 2. During the following 6 years , preparation for war and war itself solved the unemployment problem for them .	And Roosevelt and Landon , and Truman and Dewey . Where did they get those candidates ? The Republican Party for 25 years has put up candidates , and , as a party , has taken the position against every piece of progressive legislation that serves the people , from minimum wage to unemployment compensation , to better housing , to aid for education , to more equal rights for all Americans , for a stronger defense for a stronger and more vital society .

1828	unemployment	attack	 This letter from this 12-year-old boy sums up the concern that I found all over the United States as we have traveled this country north , east , west , and south . This concern and the idea that this is the major of this campaign is held not only by Republicans but by Democrats and independents , and I find that as far as this particular issue is concerned , it transcends all the rest , because while people , of course , are interested in how government can provide the climate in which we can continue to have good jobs and high wages and how government can provide the necessary procedures through which we can have social security in times of unemployment and better schools and hospitals - while they are interested in these things , they know it does n't make any difference if we had all those things if we are not around to enjoy them . I say to you the biggest , major issue which we should talk about today above all others is this : Which of the two candidates for the Vice Presidency and the Presidency can best provide the leadership for America and the free world in these next 4 years which will keep the peace without surrender and which will extend the freedom throughout the world .	I am proud of this support . I know that the American labor movement wants for America what I want for America : the elimination of poverty and unemployment , the reestablishment of America 's position of leadership in the world , the end of racial discrimination everywhere in our society . I know the American labor movement opposes what I oppose : complacency , unemployment , economic stagnation , and national insecurity .	Nixon_September_15_1960	Kennedy_August_30_1960

Getting down to specific problems of concern to business , Senator Kennedy feels that the most effective antidote for inflation is increased productivity and greater production .

1830	unemployment	attack	We have said the same thing in every section of the country .  Do you stand by this statement in light of the varying statements both you and your running mate have made on question of appointing a Negro to the cabinet , for example ? 8. Why do you repeat the Communist argument that unemployment was eliminated in the United States only when we have had a war economy , when the fact is that unemployment during the Truman administration averaged about a million less than during the administration even though the level of defense expenditures - including the Korean war - was lower than it has been during the present administration ? 9. Why have you stated that I support a minimum wage which  official studies show would force unemployment and business failures  when there are no such studies , just administration assertion that this might happen - assertions like those made by Republicans every time an increase in the minimum wage is proposed ? 10 . Why do you blame the present huge agricultural surpluses on the policies your party inherited , when the fact is that at the end of the Truman administration total farm surpluses were valued at $ 2.5 billion , while the present value is $ 8.5 billion ? I have received today a report from Mayor Richard C. Lee , of New Haven , Conn .	One will never learn from my opponent that employment declined less than seasonally last month and that unemployment went down more than seasonally . Unemployment dropped not only as to number but also as a percentage of the labor force . His pessimistic talk today recalls to my mind the situation in 1953 when the Eisenhower administration assumed responsibility for the Nation 's affairs .	Kennedy_October_20_1960	Nixon_October_19_1960

We find generally the standards of health care have been improved more in this 7 years than in the preceding 7 years . Highways ? You know the record there .	Others can be financed through closing tax loopholes and better enforcing our tax laws . Some programs - such as medical care for the aged and self-liquidating power projects - are not a burden on the taxpayers . Above all , I am convinced that a nation on the move , growing at a more rapid rate than we have for the past eight years - with more people working and more industries operating at full capacity - will produce far more revenues without an increase in taxes .

I mean that we will always be willing to go the extra mile , as he has been willing to go , to negotiate for disarmament , to negotiate for reducing tensions , but we will always recognize that in dealing with the Communist dictators or any dictators , that giving them an inch does n't mean that they will take a mile . They will take the whole world .	Well , it is , Jackie , of course , the great problem . And I really do n't think that we 've made enough progress , for example , in the area of disarmament in the last years . We 've only had about 100 people working in the entire Federal Government on the subject of disarmament , the subject of nuclear testing .	Nixon_November_2_1960	Kennedy_November_2_1960

This administration has sat by while here in California , in Los Angeles , in San Diego , in Pennsylvania where I was yesterday , in Ohio , in West Virginia , and in Kentucky , nearly 4.5 million Americans are wholly out of work and 3 million others work 1 , 2 , or 3 days a week when they can get it . As long as this administration holds back in providing assistance to education , practical physical and monetary policies that hold back employment , hold back the distribution of defense in a stronger problem , our indifference in the problem of medical care for our older citizens - Mr. Nixon says it is too extreme . He prefers a proposal that provides that the 16 million Americans who live on an average income of $ 73 a month should take a pauper 's oath rather than put it under social security where it has been for 25 years .

But anyone who believes as I do that this country will never be strong in the world , that we will never be successful in turning Mr. Khrushchev back , we will never be successful in expanding freedom around the world unless we have in this country a strong and vital and progressive society , and that is what we are committed to , that is what we are committed to , and I believe the American people on November 8 , faced with a choice of a leadership that looks to the past and the present , and recognizing that this country , the only hope of freedom that there is , we are the only sentinel at the gate , and if we do n't move ahead , if we do n't provide employment for our people , if we do n't use our facilities to the fullest , if we do n't educate our children and provide under social security medical care for our aged and jobs for those in between , then the United States , instead of being the leader of the free world , will cease to count as the only hope of freedom . Mr. Khrushchev does not take a country as seriously - when he is able last week to produce almost as much steel as the United States , and he is now producing twice as many scientists and engineers .	My friends , too often we think of government in Washington , D.C., as something very far away from us . After all , you elect a President , a Vice President , a Congressman and a Senator ; and the House and Senate meet and decisions are made , but you think , really , that is n't nearly as important as what happens to the prices in the grocery store , to what happens to your schools , to what happens to your medical care , to what happens in all the other fields I could mention . Let me say this , my friends : Today what happens in Washington will affect the prices of everything you buy at the grocery store .	Kennedy_October_28_1960	Nixon_October_27_1960
1839	medical care,health care	no_relation	We 're going to have to have more in the field of education . We 're going to have to have a better program in the field of medical care , but my friends , the reason why my programs are better for America than those of my opponent is this . That his would turn all of these problems over to the Federal Government , they would cost an amount equal - get this - each year to almost the entire gold reserve of America that 's in Fort Knox , and do you know what that means to you ? It means higher prices , higher taxes for the American people .	There is this much logic in the Republican position : It is true that under their policies , where we have three recessions in just 6 years , where we have the lowest rate of economic growth of any industrial country in the world , then there are many things we ca n't afford . But it is equally true that , if we put our economy to work - if we achieve the rate of 4- to 5-percent growth every year that is within our reach - then we will have the added resources to devote to schools and hospitals and medical care for the aged , housing , and conservation . The Republican candidate proposes to continue his party 's restrictive policies .	Nixon_October_28_1960	Kennedy_October_28_1960
1840	unemployment	no_relation	Thank you very much . Mr. Nixon 's contention that the hard-hit unemployment areas of the country would have received more help under the administration area redevelopment bill than under the Douglas - Flood bill , which I supported and which President Eisenhower vetoed , is patently absurd . The Vice President is reported to have said in Scranton , Pa .	We come from all continents , from all countries , from all races and all religions and what better evidence of it than here ? I recall talking to Mr. Herbert Hoover at the time he was working with me on the Hungarian refugee problems , trying to develop programs for the refugees . Concern was expressed at that time about changing our immigration laws to allow more refugees to come in , concern with regard to the effect on employment and unemployment in this country , concern as to how these people could be assimilated . His answer was that every wave of refugees that has come to the United States has strengthened America rather than weakened it .	Kennedy_September_20_1960	Nixon_September_19_1960
1841	cuba	no_relation	I say in that connection that with all the criticism of President Eisenhower 's administration , they ca n't take away the solid fact that under his leadership we got the United States out of one war ; we 've kept her out of other wars , and we do have peace without surrender today . Yes , there are problems , problems like the one in Cuba that my opponent is discussing tonight without offering any solution for , and , incidentally , may I say , looking at that problem , I will have more to say about that at a later time , and he had better look to the record of his administration before he starts criticizing ours in that field . He talks about dictators , and I can only say that the number of dictators we inherited from the Truman administration is far greater than the number we have today in Latin America , and that 's something he must remember .	I want to talk with you tonight about the most glaring failure of American foreign policy today - about a disaster that threatens the security of the whole Western Hemisphere - about a Communist menace that has been permitted to arise under our very noses , only 90 miles from our shores . I am talking about the one friendly island that our own shortsighted policies helped make communism 's first Caribbean base : the island of Cuba . Two years ago in September of 1958 - bands of bearded rebels descended from Cuba 's Sierra Maestra Mountains and began their long march on Havana - a march which ended in the overthrow of the brutal , bloody , and despotic dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista .

But that means $ 3,000 more he pays for that house before he pays off his mortgage , and that is one reason why housing starts are off 20 percent this year , even though our population is increasing by 3 million a year . That is why there is unemployment in lumberyards and that is why some of our mills in Oregon are closing down . In 1952 , a typical school district wanting to build a million-dollar school faced interest on their bonds of $ 328,000 .	Nixon_October_19_1960	Kennedy_October_17_1960

The same thing happened to a degree in the minimum wage . I am not saying that some members of the Democratic Party did not vote against us .	You have the Kennedy bill , which would raise the minimum wage on a graduated basis to a dollar and a quarter in 3 years , and which would expand coverage to 5 million people not presently covered . You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase . It takes coverage away from some .	Kennedy_September_1_1960	Nixon_August_13_1960

I want a $ 1.25 an hour minimum wage , medical care for the aged through social security , Federal aid to help raise teachers salaries as well as schools , an adequate program of slum clearance and low-rent housing , and a program of aid to areas of chronic unemployment which would include northern Minnesota . These are my goals .	[ Cheers . ] But you k now what could be more important than our job ? What could be more important than our education for our young people ? What could be more important than health care for our older citizens and for ourselves ? And the answer is being around to enjoy all these good things . So I say to you today that the most important decision you will make on November 8 is this : Which of the candidates for the Presidency , for the Vice Presidency , can best furnish the leadership that will keep the peace for America without surrender and extend freedom throughout the world ?

1846	unemployment	attack	But both of them lived many , many years longer , and both of them , the longer they lived , gained love and affection from the American people - and I would only hope tonight that , however this election turns out , Senator Kennedy and I in the years ahead will be able to conduct ourselves with the dignity , the decency which earned the esteem and the love of the American people for the two men who were engaged in that great campaign of 1928 . The decline in unemployment throughout the country reported last week by the Departments of Labor and Commerce is good news for America . It must have come as a disappointing surprise to the opposition camp from which we are hearing so much foreboding talk about the future these days .	And unemployment is not insignificant to the Democratic Party - which has always pursued a policy of full employment - which has never said that there  must be some unemployment  and which is going to see that there are jobs for all Americans in the sixties . In fact , unemployment is only insignificant to Mr. Nixon and a Republican Party which has opposed every Democratic effort to put men back to work in the past 8 years - which has complacently stood by while unemployment rose from less than 2 million in 1952 to 4 million today and while Michigan lost more than 100,000 jobs despite an expanding population . For I believe that the American people are going to reject a party which - again in Mr. Nixon 's words - believes that  unemployment is inevitable ,  a party which lacks faith in the capacity of a strong and growing America to provide jobs for all its people , a party which , in the most fundamental sense , is letting America run down because it is failing to build America up , a party whose candidate is all too ready to threaten war but is unwilling to build up the strength which is the only guarantee of peace , who is always willing to speak loudly , but is unwilling to be sure that America carries a big stick .

And to meet the pressing problem confronting men past working age , and their families , we must put through an effective program of medical care for the aged under the social security system . The present medical care program will not send one penny to needy persons without further action by the Congress and the State legislatures .	I stand for programs , in addition , which will build the schools that America needs . We stand for programs which will provide for increased and better medical care for our citizens , and particularly for those who need it , who are in the older age brackets - and I will discuss that more a little later . We stand for progress in all of these fields , and certainly , as I stand here before you , I am proud to be a part of that platform and of that program .	Kennedy_October_9_1960	Nixon_October_6_1960

[ Applause .	We know what peace demands . We will always go the extra mile to strengthen peace , the extra mile to work for disarmament , the extra mile to reduce tensions , but we will always remember that the man we are dealing with and his colleagues are ruthless , fanatical aggressors and that they do not follow the rules of the game that we would like them to follow , and that we must treat them the way they are , and this means that we must never make a concession without being sure that we 're getting one in return , that we must never agree , for example , to disarmament unless we can be sure that they , too , are disarming . Why is this necessary for peace ? Because , as I said at my last stop , we 've got to remember that as long as the United States maintains its present position of being stronger than anyone who threatens the peace of the world we can be the guardians of peace ; but the moment that somebody or some nation that does not want peace - in other words , that would use war as an instrument of conquest - is stronger than we are , or thinks they are , then peace is no longer safe .

And with Martin Luther King in jail Mr. Nixon 's headquarters issued a statement  No comment .	The Republican program in education , unlike Mr. Kennedy 's would provide funds for school construction which would enable State and local districts to use their money for raising teachers salaries , without involving the Government in the direct payment of teachers salaries which would lead toward dictation from Washington as to what is taught in our schools to our children . It is a matter of record that Republicans have extended social security and strengthened minimum wage legislation . Moreover , we care too much for people to advocate programs , as my opponent does , which would raise Federal spending by over $ 15 billion a year - programs so great they could be paid for , not out of miracles of economic growth , but by 180 million Americans in higher taxes and higher prices .

We say that the answer to the problem of health care for our old people is our way and not theirs . Why ? Because ours is a program which leaves to the individual the choice , the choice of what he wants in the way of protection .	I consider that waste , too . There are many kinds of waste , and I think it is the function of government to use our resources to the fullest , to use our natural and material and human resources to the fullest , to educate our children , to build a stronger economy , to provide medical care for our aged under social security , to use to the fullest those areas of the United States where unemployment has been chronic for a great many years , to use our brains and our energy to build a stronger and better society here in the United States .

As far as our opponent is concerned , I would only suggest this : We have a pretty good idea what he would do , too , and , based on what he has said in this campaign , how he disagreed with the President on Quemoy and Matsu , how he suggested that the President could have apologized to Khrushchev at Paris , is almost certainly the most irresponsible proposal ever advocated by a Presidential candidate with regard to Cuba - when you consider these things , I say that we can not afford the inexperience of a man like that as President of the United States . And , of course , some people may well say ,  But , Mr. Nixon , he 's changed his mind about Quemoy and Matsu .	Kennedy_October_28_1960	Nixon_October_27_1960
1855	medical care,health care	support	I believe that the most effective method is through a program which will provide a choice whereby people who want to have the protection for catastrophic illnesses or , for that matter , for noncatastrophic illnesses , if they so desire , can have it , but where they are not forced to have it if they do not desire , and where they can choose getting that protection through government or through private plans , which they might choose , with some government assistance . And I would agree with Senator Kennedy , incidentally , to this extent : he indicated that this would be an issue in the campaign , I think it will be an issue in the campaign , and the question will not be one of ends , because both of us believe that there should he protection for our older citizens for medical care . The question will be one of means .	I refer , of course , to the Social Security Act of 1935 . It is particularly appropriate that we mark that anniversary by the extension of the system to include medical care insurance for our older citizens . A quarter of a century ago , the people of the United States turned their back on the dole and the means test , and chose instead to rely on self-financed insurance , paid through the social security system , to protect themselves against the hazards of old age .

1859	cuba	no_relation	No.2, until our relations with Cuba became so sour that we broke off the sugar quota , the United States almost ignored the needs of Latin America for long-term capital . The authorization which Congress passed in August for the benefit of Latin America was directly tied , unfortunately , in the minds of many Latin Americans as well as in the minds of many Americans , to our troubles with Cuba . Therefore , you have people in Latin America as I said earlier today , running for office , as they are in Brazil , and their platforms are un-American .	And I am speaking now of the United Nations , of the Organization of American States - Oh , you know , a lot of people say to me sometimes ,  Why do we worry about these organizations like this ? We 're strong enough . Why do n't we move into the Congo as Khrushchev did , unilaterally ? Why do n't we go into Cuba unilaterally , on our own , instead of working through all the rest of the American States as we have ?  And the answer is this : The United States can not and must not do this because if we are going to have real peace and real security in the world , we must have other free nations and other peace-loving nations working with us , rather than against us . And we must set an ideal - an ideal which they will follow - an ideal that we will work with these organizations to see that things that otherwise would be settled on the battlefield , are settled at the conference table .

With careful planning for reconversion , this State would enjoy a greater boom under disarmament than it ever enjoyed in the cold war . For peace is our deepest aspiration .	I think you could get a resolution through in the forthcoming General Assembly that would accomplish a lot . Q. Mr. Ambassador , have you had time to catch up today on the Russian proposal for a kind of summit meeting in the General Assembly on disarmament ? A. Yes . I heard about it .

1861	disarmament	no_relation	Whenever that balance changes , whenever the Soviet Union gains strength as against our strength , war 's danger increases , because they are wanting to use their strength not as we are , for peace , but to conquer the world . So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war . That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests .	And even this handful of workers has been scattered through four or five agencies with little coordination or leadership . A recent independent survey concluded : The only continuous features of our efforts in the disarmament field have been a lack of continuity in top personnel and a paucity of planning and research efforts . As a result of this failure we have been steadily unprepared on disarmament .	Nixon_October_27_1960	Kennedy_October_23_1960
1862	medical care,health care	support	All we have to do is develop them . We have programs , programs that I have enunciated during this campaign that will build the schools , that will improve our medical care , particularly for our older people , that will move us ahead in science , for the new breakthroughs of this scientific revolution that will build a better life for all Americans than we 've had before . And that is as it should be , because I remember one thing my father always used to say when we were growing up .	In 1937 and 1938 , 90 percent of the Republicans voted against the 25-cent minimum wage . This summer , when we tried to improve the standards of social security by providing medical care for the aged tied to social security , again the great majority of the Republicans , over 90 percent , voted against medical care for the aged tied to social security . Eighty percent of the members of the House of Representatives who are Republicans voted against the $ 1.25 minimum wage , $ 50 a week for a 40-hour week for an industry , a business , that makes more than a million dollars a year .

With careful planning for reconversion , this State would enjoy a greater boom under disarmament than it ever enjoyed in the cold war . For peace is our deepest aspiration .	And the reason that we insist that disarmament must not be just a fine slogan but that it must be honest and that there must be an agreement which will see that both sides keep it is not because we do not want disarmament but because we do want disarmament . We want the fact of disarmament rather than the fiction of it which is what the Soviets up to this time have been offering , since they have not offered inspection along with it . [ Applause .

1864	medical care,health care	no_relation	In every town and every city I have visited today - and I have been down in Lancaster and Erie , in Syracuse , and now I 've come to Rochester - I have had a report on the speeches my opponent has made while he was here . In those speeches , over and over again , there was the same refrain - he said Mr. Nixon and his party are against aid to education ; they 're against education ; they 're against medical care for the aged ; they 're against social security . I 'll read what he said about that .	For only specific proposals backed by action will meet the problems , and the long history of the Democratic Party , as well as the voting records of the two presidential candidates , is a clear demonstration that only under the leadership of the Democratic Party can we hope to make a real progress in creating a better life for our older citizens . I have pledged myself and my party to the immediate enactment of a program of medical care for the aged through social security - a soundly financed program without a degrading pauper 's oath and with adequate benefits . And if I am elected President next Tuesday , that pledge will not be filed away with old and unmeant campaign promises ; it will be at the very top of my agenda for action .

But then the White House added ,  Unemployment is widely disappearing . We are nearing the final triumph over poverty than ever before in the history of our land .	He knows it , the economy is moving up . He knows that unemployment went down more than seasonally last month and employment went up more than seasonally , and you know a funny thing ?

( 4 ) Unemployment : Mr. Nixon , who thinks several million unemployed is inevitable and nothing to worry about , is satisfied today with what he calls our  unprecedented prosperity  - but I think we can do better in putting our unemployed back to work , using our idle capacity in steel , coal and other industries , and finding jobs for the thousands of young men and women who are pouring into our labor market every week of the year . ( 5 ) Trusting the voters : Mr. Nixon and the Republicans are unwilling to reveal to the American people reports containing the facts about our prestige , the truth about the Nixon - Khrushchev talks , the basis of the present missile gap as contained in the Gaither report , and the facts about whether we are heading for a third recession prepared by the Department of Commerce .	Steel production is going up . Unemployment is going down , and we find that more Americans are employed today , earning more , spending more , investing more than at any time in history . Why ? Because the American people believe in America .	Kennedy_October_31_1960	Nixon_October_29_1960
1868	disarmament	support	First , it has been suggested that it is your objective to pose as a champion of disarmament . You are said to be bringing new disarmament proposals with you . If they are at all constructive and negotiable , I hope we in this country will stand ready to consider them .	Now , if I might turn to one other point that I think should be covered on an occasion like this , what should be our diplomatic policy in these years ahead ? Diplomatically , the United States , as the President indicated at Baltimore this morning , must always be ready and willing to sit down at the conference table and discuss disarmament , to discuss any differences that we have with any other nation in the world , because we must work for peace constantly ; but on the other hand , let 's remember , as the President also said this morning , when it comes to disarmament we must never forget that we can take nothing on faith , because America must never give up any of its own strength unless we know that the potential enemies of freedom and of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time . In other words , we can have disarmament only with inspection , with the guarantees which the President has insisted upon and which we will insist upon in the next administration as well . And in the negotiations that we have , as far as these guidelines are concerned , may I suggest these other things should be remembered as well ; we must be firm in our dealings with the Soviet , as I have indicated , but we must be nonbelligerent .

But he knows that his rump session of the Congress did n't do a thing about it , and we will , and it 's time we ought to lay these things out so that the people can understand it .	I was the floor manager and as chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor brought the first area redevelopment bill to the floor of the Senate . We passed that bill for depressed areas , and I represented a number of them - the city of Lawrence Mass , had 30 percent unemployment for 4 years . I brought that bill and managed it through the Senate .	Nixon_October_28_1960	Kennedy_October_28_1960
1870	minimum wage	support	We only need a few more . A shift of four or five votes in the House last June would have enacted a real minimum wage bill , with coverage for several million more families and a minimum of $ 1.25 an hour . Next January we will have those votes - and you will have a President who knows what a strong minimum wage law means to stop runaway shops and to raise living standards .	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .

1871	disarmament	support	Mr. Nixon may now say he has been urging an acceleration of our defense all along - but in his August 10 press conference the President said he knew of no such different viewpoint by the Vice President , adding :  Certainly if there is , he has n't come to me about it .  What was the Security Council doing while the Nation was undergoing this experience ? Why would anyone point with pride to presiding over successive blows to our security and prestige - Indochina , Hungary , Suez , Sputnik , the riots in Venezuela , the collapse of the summit , the riots in Japan , the collapse of the Baghdad Pact , the failure of disarmament , the U-2 fiasco , and now Cuba and the Congo ? Why would anyone boast about presiding over the Security Council during the years it rejected the now accepted findings of the Gaither report , the Killian report , and the Rockefeller report - during the years it held back our missiles and frustrated our efforts in Space - during the years it failed to come up with one new idea of any importance : for  Atoms for Peace  was a slogan , the Eisenhower Middle East Doctrine was a farce , the  open skies  plan was a gesture , and the Baghdad Pact was a failure . Mr. Nixon has presided , in short , over the decline of our national security .	But at the present time there is still a chance that the negotiations can result in an agreement in which testing will be discontinued by both the Soviet Union and the United States , or at least not resumed by both , assuming both have discontinued them , and that this agreement will have with it inspection procedures . Now the reason that it is vitally important that we continue to press forward until there is obviously no chance of success is that if we can get an agreement on nuclear testing , suspension of nuclear testing , with inspection , it opens the door and paves the way for disarmament with inspection . And this must be the goal of the President of the United States , whatever party he may be from .	Kennedy_August_24_1960	Nixon_August_13_1960

When the Republican Party nominated Mr. Nixon , they not only selected a leader - they selected a man whose record had proven him to be a true heir and representative of this historic Republican tradition - a man who led the opposition to medical care for the aged . And a man who was ready to carry on that opposition .	Hospitals ? We have built more hospitals in this 7 years than in the preceding 7 years . Health ? We find generally the standards of health care have been improved more in this 7 years than in the preceding 7 years . Highways ? You know the record there .

Unemployment dropped not only as to number but also as a percentage of the labor force .	[ Applause . ] Can you possibly say that our power is increasing when you know that next winter and next spring the United States will face a most serious crisis over Berlin at a time when our strength is not rising in relation to that of the Communists ? Do you feel that this administration has solved the problem of unemployment , when we have more people out of work now , this fall , than any time except for the three postwar recessions ? Do you feel that your children are going to get jobs when you realize that we have to find 25,000 new jobs a week for the next 10 years in order to provide employment for our people ? I believe this country can meet its responsibilities , to its own citizens and those around the world , but I think we have to do better than we are doing and that is the issue . Do you agree ?

Disarmament today is just as complicated as armaments - involving complex problems of surveillance , reconnaissance , seismography , atmospheric sampling and testing stations . A successful blueprint for a safe disarmament is as difficult to devise as a successful blueprint for modern war .

It takes coverage away from some .	Let me be still more precise . There are 35,000 workers in the apparel industry in New York City alone who depend upon the Fair Labor Standards Act for a fair minimum wage .

But in the two areas , two areas where peace can he won in the field of disarmament and in our representations abroad this country has been ill served .

He makes campaign promises to help our distressed areas and our unemployed workers - but as Vice President he has consistently opposed our party 's efforts , sparked by Senator Douglas , to get such measures enacted .	Meanwhile , the contradictory statements of Senator Kennedy still leave him opposed to this position . The misstatement : In the second debate Senator Kennedy said : The Republicans in recent years , not only in the last 25 years , but in the last 8 years , have opposed * * * minimum wage * * The facts : Senator Kennedy is saying that Republicans who opposed his particular bill are against minimum wage . The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve .

The point is : the Soviet Union is blocking the road to disarmament , blocking the road to stopping tests . Why ? Because they want a closed society and they want no inspection .	The pursuit of peace is still the focus of our leadership , our energies , and our determination . And disarmament is still the most vital step on the road to a lasting peace . The great question of the 1960 's - the overriding concern of all Americans and all men - is whether , in the coming decade , the world will move toward a secure peace and the survival of mankind or whether we will move toward war and common destruction .

You can learn about political science by participating in political organizations , and I would say certainly a political science course under the very able people who instruct you in our colleges and universities is worth while , but particularly to those who want to enter public service , if I could leave just one note - Remember , that while the broad background in the humanities and history and literature would seem to be very remote from the problems of Ghana and Cuba , from the problems of what we do about health care and what we do about the filibuster , remember those are the courses that will give you the judgment and the depth that is needed to react properly and intelligently to these great issues when they come before you years later , if you happen to enter public life . The last point that I would make is this : I want everybody here to certainly feel the necessity for , as I put it , going into politics ; I do n't mean all of you should run for office .	[ Applause . ] If the United States is going to maintain its position of being a friend of freedom in Latin America , if we are going to be successful in this struggle which is now going on , not merely on the island of Cuba , but all over Latin America , we have to be identified , not merely in the fight against communism , but in the fight against poverty and disease , in the fight that those people are waging for a better life for themselves , and in my judgment the United States is not now in their minds identified with that fight . If we lose that psychological struggle , if Castro or his counterparts in other countries of Latin America are able to suggest that we are indifferent , that we are rich , that we are prosperous , that we do not look at their problems , I believe the future of Latin America will be far different than it could be if we identify ourselves as Franklin Roosevelt did with their problems , with their opportunities and join with them .

Yes , there are problems , problems like the one in Cuba that my opponent is discussing tonight without offering any solution for , and , incidentally , may I say , looking at that problem , I will have more to say about that at a later time , and he had better look to the record of his administration before he starts criticizing ours in that field . He talks about dictators , and I can only say that the number of dictators we inherited from the Truman administration is far greater than the number we have today in Latin America , and that 's something he must remember .	For we have not only supported a dictatorship in Cuba - we have propped up dictators in Venezuela , Argentina , Colombia , Paraguay , and the Dominican Republic . We not only ignored poverty and distress in Cuba - we have failed in the past 8 years to relieve poverty and distress throughout the hemisphere . For despite the bleak poverty that grips nearly all of Latin America - with an average income of less than $ 285 a year - with an exploding population that threatens even this meager standard of living - yet our aid programs have continued to concentrate on wasteful military assistance until we made a sudden recognition of their needs for development capital practically at the point of Mr. Castro 's gun .

We know what peace demands . We will always go the extra mile to strengthen peace , the extra mile to work for disarmament , the extra mile to reduce tensions , but we will always remember that the man we are dealing with and his colleagues are ruthless , fanatical aggressors and that they do not follow the rules of the game that we would like them to follow , and that we must treat them the way they are , and this means that we must never make a concession without being sure that we 're getting one in return , that we must never agree , for example , to disarmament unless we can be sure that they , too , are disarming . Why is this necessary for peace ? Because , as I said at my last stop , we 've got to remember that as long as the United States maintains its present position of being stronger than anyone who threatens the peace of the world we can be the guardians of peace ; but the moment that somebody or some nation that does not want peace - in other words , that would use war as an instrument of conquest - is stronger than we are , or thinks they are , then peace is no longer safe .

And do we lose prestige when in Cuba , where we have all the power in the world , we do not use the power , but we work through an Organization of American States to attempt to bring that country back into the paths of freedom ? Does he gain and we lose ? Of course not . Does he gain prestige when he breaks up a conference like the Paris Conference , when he blocks the road to peace ?

Let 's face it : It took war to solve the unemployment riddle for them . After the war was over opposition spokesmen forecast some 6 million unemployed .	Today , the country has 126 areas of substantial labor surplus - areas like Bay City , Flint , and the Iron Range - areas of declining industry - where there is poverty and hunger - where men have been searching for work , but can not find work . Unemployment in any of these areas harms the entire Nation , depriving all our industry of markets , decreasing total purchasing power , and depriving us of needed production .

It is a matter of record that Republicans have extended social security and strengthened minimum wage legislation . Moreover , we care too much for people to advocate programs , as my opponent does , which would raise Federal spending by over $ 15 billion a year - programs so great they could be paid for , not out of miracles of economic growth , but by 180 million Americans in higher taxes and higher prices .

Senator John F. Kennedy , Democrat of Massachusetts , tonight expressed strong satisfaction with the minimum wage bill , voted by the Senate 62 to 34 . The minimum wage bill , as passed by the Senate today , will extend protection of the minimum wage and the overtime requirements to approximately 4 million additional employees and will also provide for an increase to $ 1.25 in the existing minimum wage .

1899	disarmament	attack	And you ask about prestige . What do our opponents think ? Do they think that Mr. Khrushchev gains prestige for the Communists when he takes off his shoe at the United Nations and pounds the table with it ? I say no. I say that President Eisenhower gained prestige for America when with great dignity and great responsibility , he stood for peace , for disarmament , for all the things that Americans believe in. No , my friends , the real test of prestige , if our prestige was low , I can assure you , would occur in the United Nations , and there what do we find ? In every instance where we 've had a test vote - and listen to this - in the last 7 years , with the Soviet Union on one side and the United States on the other , we have won ; and in the vote on the Congo we won , 70 to nothing . My friends , that 's a pretty good score in football .	And this administration has failed to recognize the decisive nature of what science is doing to our hopes for the future . This administration has had less than 100 people working in the entire national administration on the subject of disarmament . We have gone into every conference unprepared .

1901	minimum wage	attack	Meanwhile , the contradictory statements of Senator Kennedy still leave him opposed to this position . The misstatement : In the second debate Senator Kennedy said : The Republicans in recent years , not only in the last 25 years , but in the last 8 years , have opposed * * * minimum wage * * The facts : Senator Kennedy is saying that Republicans who opposed his particular bill are against minimum wage . The administration supported an increase in the minimum wage in 1955 , and in 1957 urged legislation to extend minimum wage coverage to some 3 million additional workers , an extension which the Democratic-led Congress failed to approve .	I want to thank you very much . We fought in the last Congress for a bill to provide $ 1.25 minimum wage for restaurant employees , retail stores and all the rest . Mr. Nixon says it is extreme .

1902	minimum wage	attack	Senator John F. Kennedy , Democrat of Massachusetts , tonight expressed strong satisfaction with the minimum wage bill , voted by the Senate 62 to 34 . The minimum wage bill , as passed by the Senate today , will extend protection of the minimum wage and the overtime requirements to approximately 4 million additional employees and will also provide for an increase to $ 1.25 in the existing minimum wage . The bill which passed the Senate provides for new coverage for employees of retail and retail service enterprises having annual gross sales of a million dollars or more , for employees in laundries with an annual gross sales of a million dollars , for local transit workers , seamen , telephone operators , and employees engaged in fish processing .	The administration 's position is in between . We would extend coverage to approximately 3 million not presently covered , and the coverage which we would extend is to those particular businesses which operate interstate and which have larger gross incomes and , therefore , businesses that we think could , therefore , pay the minimum wage , not resulting in unemployment , which might result if such businesses covered by the broader coverage of the Kennedy bill were brought under the minimum wage . I think the administration bill is the proper approach , and within the Senate at the present time , where the legislation currently is lodged , I am pressing for adoption of the administration bill .

1903	cuba	no_relation	I do not know how he can seek the Presidency and avoid explaining what happened in this major foreign policy disaster . But it did happen - and the question now is , What do we do about Cuba and Castro now ? What can a new administration do to end this drift ? 1. The first thing we have to do is let the Cuban people know our determination that they will someday again be free . We did not make clear to the Cubans our devotion to freedom during the brutal reign of the Batista dictatorship - and we are not making our position any clearer under the Castro dictatorship .	These are the times that you can read and have the time to read that you will never have later , and you can get the opportunity to specialize much later . You can learn about political science by participating in political organizations , and I would say certainly a political science course under the very able people who instruct you in our colleges and universities is worth while , but particularly to those who want to enter public service , if I could leave just one note - Remember , that while the broad background in the humanities and history and literature would seem to be very remote from the problems of Ghana and Cuba , from the problems of what we do about health care and what we do about the filibuster , remember those are the courses that will give you the judgment and the depth that is needed to react properly and intelligently to these great issues when they come before you years later , if you happen to enter public life . The last point that I would make is this : I want everybody here to certainly feel the necessity for , as I put it , going into politics ; I do n't mean all of you should run for office .

1904	minimum wage	no_relation	You have the Kennedy bill , which would raise the minimum wage on a graduated basis to a dollar and a quarter in 3 years , and which would expand coverage to 5 million people not presently covered . You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase . It takes coverage away from some .	To pass them by - to water down the help they need - or merely assume that prosperity at the top will someday reach them - shocks the conscience of those who care . The increases in purchasing power resulting from a higher minimum wage will help to restore consumer demand required to put our idle industrial capacity back to work . The elimination of unfair competition based upon substandard wages will protect fairminded employers anxious to maintain fair labor standards .	Nixon_August_13_1960	Kennedy_August_10_1960
1905	minimum wage	no_relation	But these rivers in the New York area are not so clean and we have to do a better job of maintaining them if you are going to bring industry in that needs fresh water . 3. I think this administration should pass a minimum wage of $ 1.25 an hour . [ Applause .	I think , as you are aware , you actually have three bills which are potentially before the Congress . You have the Kennedy bill , which would raise the minimum wage on a graduated basis to a dollar and a quarter in 3 years , and which would expand coverage to 5 million people not presently covered . You have the House bill , which would raise the minimum wage to $ 1.15 in 1 year , and which would expand coverage to a much lower number , approximately a million , net increase .

1906	disarmament	no_relation	Well , let me say that in the first place I think his purpose in coming here could be manifold . First , he may have some new proposals on disarmament which he hopes to capture the attention of the world with . Second I think he thinks that the General Assembly of the United Nations is going to be increasingly influential and powerful .	I 'm confident of what America can do in the years ahead , provided that Americans know the problems , face up to the challenge , and stay true to the principles that have made this country great . Now , if I might turn to one other point that I think should be covered on an occasion like this , what should be our diplomatic policy in these years ahead ? Diplomatically , the United States , as the President indicated at Baltimore this morning , must always be ready and willing to sit down at the conference table and discuss disarmament , to discuss any differences that we have with any other nation in the world , because we must work for peace constantly ; but on the other hand , let 's remember , as the President also said this morning , when it comes to disarmament we must never forget that we can take nothing on faith , because America must never give up any of its own strength unless we know that the potential enemies of freedom and of peace are also reducing their strength at the same time . In other words , we can have disarmament only with inspection , with the guarantees which the President has insisted upon and which we will insist upon in the next administration as well .

1907	disarmament	support	I know that you must never make a concession to him without getting one in return . I know that you must never agree to disarmament , for example , unless you have an ironclad agreement from him that he 's going to do likewise . I know that that kind of firmness is what leads to peace .	But no matter how difficult the problems are , how discouraging the obstacles , how uncertain the prospect for agreement , we must , nevertheless , begin a determined , large-scale effort to prepare ourselves for disarmament - to formulate constructive and realistic proposals which have a chance of success . For the hopes of all mankind rest on successful disarmament . And if we let the nations of Africa and Asia and Latin America feel that the United States is the real obstacle to disarmament , that we are not sincere in our desire for peace - if we continue to let the Soviet Union seize the offensive in disarmament negotiations - then these emerging areas of the world may well turn away from America and the free world , and begin to look to the Communist bloc for leadership in the fight for peace .

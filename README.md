# bipolarABA  
  
  A **Bipolar Assumption Based Argumentation (bABA)** as presented in (Kristijonas CË‡yras, Claudia Schulz, and Francesca Toni: Capturing Bipolar Argumentation in Non-flat Assumption-Based Argumentation) is a newly proposed structured argumentation framework. baba frameworks have desirable properties which allow them to capture reasoning under a variety of **Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (BAFs)**.
  

This project provides an interface which implements reasoning using the bABA formalism. We present novel algorithms for calculating extensions of these frameworks under various semantics, a problem which is of interest in various fields of study, such as AI, Law and Medicine. 



## Usage
Users can specify the components of a bABA framework (i.e. Assumptions, Rules, Contraries). The interface will then calculate extensions of this framework under the preferred and set-stable semantics. 

The components of a bABA framework are specified as follows:
-   **myAsm(a).**  specifies that  **a**  is an assumption;
-   **contrary(a**,  **x).**  specifies that  **x**  is the contrary of assumption  **a**;
-   **myRule(h**,  **[b1**]).**  specifies that  **h <- b1** is a rule;

Alternatively, users can present the individual components of a BAF (i.e arguments, attacks, supports). The system will then map this BAF framework into a bABA framework and calculate it's extensions (It has been proven that the extensions of the bABA framework under our mapping correspond to the extensions of the original BAF).
  
The components of a BAF framework are specified as follows:

-   **arg(a).**  specifies that  **a**  is an argument;
-   **att(a**,  **b).**  specifies that  **a**  attacks  **b**;
-   **sup(a**,  **b).**  specifies that  **a**  supports  **b**;

## Developing  
  
The project comes with a set of commands you can use to run common operations for your stack:  
  
- `make install`: Installs run time dependencies.  
- `make install-dev`: Installs dev dependencies together with run time dependencies.  
- `make freeze`: Freezes dependencies from `setup.py` to `requirements.txt` (including transitive ones).  
- `make lint`: Runs static analysis.  
- `make component`: Runs component tests.  
- `make coverage`: Runs all tests collecting coverage.  
- `make test`: Runs `lint` and `component`.  
  
### Updating dependencies  
  
Dependencies are managed from the `setup.py` file and then frozen in `requirements.txt` (including transitive dependencies) using `make freeze` (which uses `pip-compile`). If you want to change dependencies, you will have to do it in `setup.py` and then regenerate them using `make freeze`.  
  
Imagine your `setup.py` looks like  
  
```  
install_requires = [  
 'pytest~=3.3.0',]  
```  
  
if you want to update `pytest` to use version 3.4, you need to change it to  
  
```  
install_requires = [  
 'pytest~=3.4.0',]  
```  
  
If you execute `make freeze`, it will regenerate the `requirements.txt` file with the new dependencies according to what the new version of `pytest` needs.
